This installer contains the core libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ library as well as the libSBML language interfaces for C#, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  It uses the @XML_PARSER@ XML parser library.

The interfaces for MATLAB and Octave are currently not supplied in this installer. If you need the MATLAB and/or Octave interfaces, please compile them directly using the libSBML source code distribution.

The default target root for the installation is /usr/local.  You can select a different root by clicking the "Customize" button in the "Installation Type" panel.  You can also select a different volume on your system by clicking on the "Change Install Location..." button in the same panel.
