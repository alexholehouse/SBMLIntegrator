  well as a textual description of the problem.  The possible severity
  levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the
  documentation for SBMLError for more information.

  If the file @p filename could not be read, the file-reading error will
  appear first.  The error code (a value drawn from the enumeration
  #XMLErrorCode_t) can provide a clue about what happened.  For example,
  a file might be unreadable (either because it does not actually exist
  or because the user does not have the necessary access priviledges to
  read it) or some sort of file operation error may have been reported
  by the underlying operating system.  Callers can check for these
  situations using a program fragment such as the following:
   @verbatim
   doc    = readSBML(filename)

   if doc.getNumErrors() > 0:
     if doc.getError(0).getErrorId() == libsbml.XMLFileUnreadable:
       # Handle case of unreadable file here.

       # Handle case of other file error here.
     else:
       # Handle other error cases here.
     
   @endverbatim

  If the given filename ends with the suffix @c '.gz' (for example, @c
  'myfile.xml.gz'), the file is assumed to be compressed in @em gzip
  format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading.
  Similarly, if the given filename ends with @c '.zip' or @c '.bz2', the
  file is assumed to be compressed in @em zip or @em bzip2 format
  (respectively).  Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read
  uncompressed.  Note that if the file is in @em zip format but the
  archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the
  archive will be read and the rest ignored.

  @htmlinclude note-reading-zipped-files.html

  @param filename the name or full pathname of the file to be read.

  @return a pointer to the SBMLDocument created from the SBML content.

  @see SBMLError

  @note LibSBML versions 2.x and later versions behave differently in
  error handling in several respects.  One difference is how early some
  errors are caught and whether libSBML continues processing a file in
  the face of some early errors.  In general, libSBML versions after 2.x
  stop parsing SBML inputs sooner than libSBML version 2.x in the face
  of XML errors, because the errors may invalidate any further SBML
  content.  For example, a missing XML declaration at the beginning of
  the file was ignored by libSBML 2.x but in version 3.x and later, it
  will cause libSBML to stop parsing the rest of the input altogether.
  While this behavior may seem more severe and intolerant, it was
  necessary in order to provide uniform behavior regardless of which
  underlying XML parser (Expat, Xerces, libxml2) is being used by
  libSBML.  The XML parsers themselves behave differently in their error
  reporting, and sometimes libSBML has to resort to the lowest common
  denominator.

    Methods for reading SBML from files and text strings.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    The SBMLReader class provides the main interface for reading SBML
    content from files and strings.  The methods for reading SBML all return
    an SBMLDocument object representing the results.

    In the case of failures (such as if the SBML contains errors or a file
    cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the SBMLErrorLog
    object kept in the SBMLDocument returned by SBMLReader.  Consequently,
    immediately after calling a method on SBMLReader, callers should always
    check for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose
    provided by SBMLDocument.

    For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++,
    this file also defines two global functions,
    libsbml.readSBML()
    and libsbml.readSBMLFromString().
    They are equivalent to creating an SBMLReader
    object and then calling the
    SBMLReader.readSBML() or
    SBMLReader.readSBMLFromString()
    methods, respectively.

    @section compression Support for reading compressed files

    LibSBML provides support for reading (as well as writing) compressed
    SBML files.  The process is transparent to the calling
    application&mdash;the application does not need to do anything
    deliberate to invoke the functionality.  If a given SBML filename ends
    with an extension for the @em gzip, @em zip or @em bzip2 compression
    formats (respectively, @c .gz, @c .zip, or @c .bz2), then the methods
    SBMLReader.readSBML() and
    SBMLWriter.writeSBML()
    will automatically decompress and compress the file while writing and
    reading it.  If the filename has no such extension, it
    will be read and written uncompressed as normal.

    The compression feature requires that the @em zlib (for @em gzip and @em
    zip formats) and/or @em bzip2 (for @em bzip2 format) be available on the
    system running libSBML, and that libSBML was configured with their
    support compiled-in.  Please see the libSBML @if clike <a href='libsbml-installation.html'>installation instructions</a> @endif@if python <a href='libsbml-installation.html'>installation instructions</a> @endif@if java  <a href='../../../libsbml-installation.html'>installation instructions</a> @endif for more information about this.  The methods
    @if java SBMLReader.hasZlib()@else hasZlib()@endif and
    @if java SBMLReader.hasBzip2()@else hasBzip2()@endif
    can be used by an application to query at run-time whether support
    for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of
    libSBML.

    Support for compression is not mandated by the SBML standard, but
    applications may find it helpful, particularly when large SBML models
    are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.

    Methods for writing SBML to files and text strings.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    The SBMLWriter class is the converse of SBMLReader, and provides the
    main interface for serializing SBML models into XML and writing the
    result to files and text strings.  The methods for writing SBML all take
    an SBMLDocument object and a destination.  They return a boolean or
    integer value to indicate success or failure.

    @section compression Support for writing compressed files

    LibSBML provides support for writing (as well as reading) compressed
    SBML files.  The process is transparent to the calling
    application&mdash;the application does not need to do anything
    deliberate to invoke the functionality.  If a given SBML filename ends
    with an extension for the @em gzip, @em zip or @em bzip2 compression
    formats (respectively, <code>&quot;.gz&quot;</code>,
    <code>&quot;.zip&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;.bz2&quot;</code>),
    then the methods
    SBMLWriter.writeSBML()
    and SBMLReader.readSBML()
    will automatically compress and decompress the file while writing and
    reading it.  If the filename has no such extension, it
    will be written and read uncompressed as normal.

    The compression feature requires that the @em zlib (for @em gzip and @em
    zip formats) and/or @em bzip2 (for @em bzip2 format) be available on the
    system running libSBML, and that libSBML was configured with their
    support compiled-in.  Please see the libSBML @if clike <a href='libsbml-installation.html'>installation instructions</a>@endif@if python <a href='libsbml-installation.html'>installation instructions</a>@endif@if java  <a href='../../../libsbml-installation.html'>installation instructions</a>@endif for 
    more information about this.  The methods
    SBMLWriter.hasZlib() and
    SBMLWriter.hasBzip2()
    can be used by an application to query at run-time whether support
    for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of
    libSBML.

    Support for compression is not mandated by the SBML standard, but
    applications may find it helpful, particularly when large SBML models
    are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.

class SBase(_object):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBase, the base class of most SBML objects.

    Most components in SBML are derived from a single abstract base type,
    SBase.  In addition to serving as the parent class for most other
    classes of objects in SBML, this base type is designed to allow a
    modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each
    major element or list in an SBML model.

    SBase has an optional subelement called 'notes'.  It is intended to
    serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by
    humans.  An example use of the 'notes' element would be to contain
    formatted user comments about the model element in which the 'notes'
    element is enclosed.  There are certain conditions on the XHTML content
    permitted inside the 'notes' element; please consult the <a
    target='_blank' href='http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications'>SBML
    specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
    of your model for more information about the requirements for 'notes'
    content.

    SBase has another optional subelement called 'annotation'.  Whereas the
    'notes' element described above is a container for content to be shown
    directly to humans, the 'annotation' element is a container for optional
    software-generated content @em not meant to be shown to humans.  The
    element's content type is <a target='_blank'
    href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls'>XML type
    'any'</a>, allowing essentially arbitrary data content.  SBML places
    only a few restrictions on the organization of the content; these are
    intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help
    reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools.  As is
    the case with 'notes', it is important to refer to the <a
    target='_blank' href='http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications'>SBML
    specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
    of your model for more information about the requirements for
    'annotation' content.

    It is worth pointing out that the 'annotation' element in the definition
    of SBase exists in order that software developers may attach optional
    application-specific data to the elements in an SBML model.  However, it
    is important that this facility not be misused.  In particular, it is
    <em>critical</em> that data essential to a model definition or that can
    be encoded in existing SBML elements is <em>not</em> stored in
    'annotation'. Parameter values, functional dependencies between model
    elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations.  It is crucial to
    keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely
    ignored by software applications.  If such data affects the
    interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly
    impeded.

    SBML Level 2 introduced an optional SBase attribute named 'metaid' for
    supporting metadata annotations using RDF (<a target='_blank'
    href='http://www.w3.org/RDF/'>Resource Description Format</a>). The
    attribute value has the data type <a
    href='http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id'>XML ID</a>, the XML identifier
    type, which means each 'metaid' value must be globally unique within an
    SBML file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion applies across any
    attribute with type <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id'>XML
    ID</a>, not just the 'metaid' attribute used by SBML&mdash;something to
    be aware of if your application-specific XML content inside the
    'annotation' subelement happens to use <a
    href='http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id'>XML ID</a>.)  The 'metaid' value
    serves to identify a model component for purposes such as referencing
    that component from metadata placed within 'annotation' subelements.

    Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, SBase also has an optional
    attribute named 'sboTerm' for supporting the use of the Systems Biology
    Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of
    the form 'SBO:NNNNNNN', where 'NNNNNNN' is a seven digit integer number;
    libSBML simplifies the representation by only storing the 'NNNNNNN'
    integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the 'sboTerm' attribute on SBase has
    data type @c int, and SBO identifiers are stored simply as integers.
    (For convenience, SBase offers methods for returning both the integer
    form and a text-string form of the SBO identifier.)  SBO terms are a
    type of optional annotation, and each different class of SBML object
    derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about the values
    permitted for 'sboTerm'.  Please consult the SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;4 specification for more information about the use of SBO
    and the 'sboTerm' attribute.

    Finally, note that, in the list of methods on SBase, there is no public
    constructor because SBase is an abstract class.  The constructors reside
    in the subclasses derived from SBase.


    @section sbase-miriam Standard format for annotations linking data resources

    SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4 define a proposed regular format for
    encoding two particular categories of annotations: (a) references to
    controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers which define and
    describe biological and biochemical entities in a model; and (b)
    descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its author(s) and
    modification history.

        Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: 'id'
        and 'name'.  The identifier given by an object's 'id' attribute value
        is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition.
        Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier.  The
        data type of 'id' is always either <code>Sid</code> or
        <code>UnitSId</code>, depending on the object in question.  Both

    def unsetName(self):

        unsetName(self) -> int

        Unsets the value of the 'name' attribute of this SBML object.

        Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: 'id'
        and 'name'.  In contrast to the 'id' attribute, the 'name' attribute is
        optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
        within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
        label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
        <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
        restrictions as to the content of 'name' attributes beyond those
        restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.

        The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
        software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
        attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
        component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
        interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
        display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
        attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
        should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
        language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
        'name'.)

        As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
        generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
        may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
        take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
        reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
        meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
        form of the name attribute value.

        An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
        restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
        restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
        allows software applications leeway in assigning component identifiers.

        The optional SBML element named 'notes', present on every major SBML
        component type, is intended as a place for storing optional

    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Model construct.

    In an SBML model definition, a single object of class Model serves as
    the overall container for the lists of the various model components.
    All of the lists are optional, but if a given list container is present
    within the model, the list must not be empty; that is, it must have
    length one or more.  The following are the components and lists
    permitted in different Levels and Versions of SBML in
    version @htmlinclude libsbml-version.html
    of libSBML:
    <ul>
    <li> In SBML Level 1, the components are: UnitDefinition, Compartment,
    Species, Parameter, Rule, and Reaction.  Instances of the classes are
    placed inside instances of classes ListOfUnitDefinitions,
    ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, and
    ListOfReactions.

    <li> In SBML Level 2 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
    UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, Rule, Reaction and
    Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes
    ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments,
    ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, ListOfReactions, and
    ListOfEvents.

    <li> In SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, the components are:
    FunctionDefinition, UnitDefinition, CompartmentType, SpeciesType,
    Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment, Rule, Constraint,
    Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside
    instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions,
    ListOfCompartmentTypes, ListOfSpeciesTypes, ListOfCompartments,
    ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
    ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.

    <li> In SBML Level 3 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
    UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment,
    Rule, Constraint, Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are
    placed inside instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions,
    ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies,
    ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
    ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.  
    </ul>

    Although all the lists are optional, there are dependencies between SBML
    components such that defining some components requires defining others.
    An example is that defining a species requires defining a compartment,
    and defining a reaction requires defining a species.  The dependencies
    are explained in more detail in the SBML specifications.

    In addition to the above lists and attributes, the Model class in both
    SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 has the usual two attributes of 'id'
    and 'name', and both are optional.  As is the case for other SBML
    components with 'id' and 'name' attributes, they must be used according
    to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.  (Within the
    frameworks of SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core, a
    Model object identifier has no assigned meaning, but extension packages
    planned for SBML Level&nbsp;3 are likely to make use of this
    identifier.)

    Finally, SBML Level&nbsp;3 has introduced a number of additional Model
    attributes.  They are discussed in a separate section below.


    @section approaches Approaches to creating objects using the libSBML API

    LibSBML provides two main mechanisms for creating objects: class
    constructors
    (e.g., @if java <a href='org/sbml/libsbml/Species.html'>Species()</a> @else Species.Species() @endif), 
    and <code>create<span class='placeholder'><em>Object</em></span>()</code>
    methods (such as Model.createSpecies()) provided by certain <span
    class='placeholder'><em>Object</em></span> classes such as Model.  These
    multiple mechanisms are provided by libSBML for flexibility and to
    support different use-cases, but they also have different implications
    for the overall model structure.

    In general, the recommended approach is to use the <code>create<span
    class='placeholder'><em>Object</em></span>()</code> methods.  These
    methods both create an object @em and link it to the parent in one step.
    Here is an example:@if clike
      @verbatim
     // Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:

     SBMLDocument sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);

     // Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
     // its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
     // created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
     // of the object attached to the model (as expected).

     Model model = sbmlDoc->createModel();
     model->setId('BestModelEver');

     // Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
     // Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
     // object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
     // of the object attached to the model (as expected).

     Speciessp = model->createSpecies();
     sp->setId('MySpecies');
     @endverbatim
    @endif@if java
     @verbatim
     // Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:

     SBMLDocument sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);

     // Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
     // its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
     // created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
     // of the object attached to the model (as expected).  Note that
     // the call to setId() returns a status code, and a real program
     // should check this status code to make sure everything went okay.

     Model model = sbmlDoc.createModel();
     model.setId(&#34;BestModelEver&#34;);

     // Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
     // Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
     // object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
     // of the object attached to the model (as expected).  Note that, like
     // with Model, the call to setId() returns a status code, and a real program
     // should check this status code to make sure everything went okay.

     Species sp = model.createSpecies();
     sp.setId(&#34;BestSpeciesEver&#34;);
     @endverbatim
    @endif@if python
     @verbatim
     # Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:

     sbmlDoc = SBMLDocument(3, 1)

     # Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
     # its identifier.  The call to setId() returns a status code
     # to indicate whether the assignment was successful.  Code 0
     # means success; see the documentation for Model's setId() for 
     # more information.

     model = sbmlDoc.createModel()
     model.setId(&#34;BestModelEver&#34;)

     # Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
     # Again, the setId() returns a status code to indicate whether the
     # assignment was successful.  Code 0 means success; see the
     # documentation for Specie's setId() for more information.

     sp = model.createSpecies()
     sp.setId(&#34;BestSpeciesEver&#34;)
     @endverbatim
    @endif@if csharp
     @verbatim
     // Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format:

     SBMLDocument sbmlDoc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1);

     // Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set
     // its identifier.  The call returns a pointer to the Model object
     // created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
     // of the object attached to the model (as expected).

     Model model = sbmlDoc.createModel();
     model.setId('BestModelEver');

     // Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
     // Similar to the lines above, this call returns a pointer to the Species
     // object created, and methods called on that object affect the attributes
     // of the object attached to the model (as expected).

     Species sp = model.createSpecies();
     sp.setId('MySpecies');
     @endverbatim
    @endif

    The <code>create<span
    class='placeholder'><em>Object</em></span>()</code> methods return a
    pointer to the object created, but they also add the object to the
    relevant list of object instances contained in the parent.  (These lists
    become the <code>&lt;listOf<span
    class='placeholder'><em>Object</em></span>s&gt;</code> elements in the
    finished XML rendition of SBML.)  In the example above,
    Model.createSpecies() adds the created species directly to the
    <code>&lt;listOfSpecies<i></i>&gt;</code> list in the model.  Subsequently,
    methods called on the species change the species in the model (which is
    what is expected in most situations).

    @section checking Consistency and adherence to SBML specifications

    To make it easier for applications to do whatever they need,
    libSBML version @htmlinclude libsbml-version.html
    is relatively lax when it comes to enforcing correctness and
    completeness of models @em during model construction and editing.
    Essentially, libSBML @em will @em not in most cases check automatically
    that a model's components have valid attribute values, or that the
    overall model is consistent and free of errors&mdash;even obvious errors
    such as duplication of identifiers.  This allows applications great
    leeway in how they build their models, but it means that software
    authors must take deliberate steps to ensure that the model will be, in
    the end, valid SBML.  These steps include such things as keeping track
    of the identifiers used in a model, manually performing updates in
    certain situations where an entity is referenced in more than one place
    (e.g., a species that is referenced by multiple SpeciesReference
    objects), and so on.

    That said, libSBML does provide powerful features for deliberately
    performing validation of SBML when an application decides it is time to
    do so.  The interfaces to these facilities are on the SBMLDocument
    class, in the form of SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency().  Please refer to the documentation for
    SBMLDocument for more information about this.

    While applications may play fast and loose and live like free spirits
    during the construction and editing of SBML models, they should always
    make sure to call SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and/or
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() before writing out the final version of
    an SBML model.


    @section model-l3-attrib Model attributes introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3

    As mentioned above, the Model class has a number of optional attributes
    in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core.  These are 'substanceUnits',
    'timeUnits', 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits', 'lengthUnits', 'extentUnits',
    and 'conversionFactor.  The following provide more information about
    them.

    @subsection model-l3-substanceunits The 'substanceUnits' attribute

    The 'substanceUnits' attribute is used to specify the unit of
    measurement associated with substance quantities of Species objects that
    do not specify units explicitly.  If a given Species object definition
    does not specify its unit of substance quantity via the 'substanceUnits'
    attribute on the Species object instance, then that species inherits the
    value of the Model 'substanceUnits' attribute.  If the Model does not
    define a value for this attribute, then there is no unit to inherit, and
    all species that do not specify individual 'substanceUnits' attribute
    values then have <em>no</em> declared units for their quantities.  The
    SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification provides more
    details.

    Note that when the identifier of a species appears in a model's
    mathematical expressions, the unit of measurement associated with that
    identifier is <em>not solely determined</em> by setting 'substanceUnits'
    on Model or Species.  Please see the discussion about units given in
    the documentation for the Species class.


    @subsection model-l3-timeunits The 'timeUnits' attribute

    The 'timeUnits' attribute on SBML Level&nbsp;3's Model object is used to
    specify the unit in which time is measured in the model.  This attribute
    on Model is the <em>only</em> way to specify a unit for time in a model.
    It is a global attribute; time is measured in the model everywhere in
    the same way.  This is particularly relevant to Reaction and RateRule
    objects in a model: all Reaction and RateRule objects in SBML define
    per-time values, and the unit of time is given by the 'timeUnits'
    attribute on the Model object instance.  If the Model 'timeUnits'
    attribute has no value, it means that the unit of time is not defined
    for the model's reactions and rate rules.  Leaving it unspecified in an
    SBML model does not result in an invalid model in SBML Level&nbsp;3;
    however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all
    models specify units of measurement for time.


    @subsection model-l3-voletc The 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits', and 'lengthUnits' attributes

    The attributes 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and 'lengthUnits' together are
    used to set the units of measurements for the sizes of Compartment
    objects in an SBML Level&nbsp;3 model when those objects do not
    otherwise specify units.  The three attributes correspond to the most
    common cases of compartment dimensions: 'volumeUnits' for compartments
    having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of @c '3', 'areaUnits' for
    compartments having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of @c '2', and
    'lengthUnits' for compartments having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute
    value of @c '1'.  The attributes are not applicable to compartments
    whose 'spatialDimensions' attribute values are @em not one of @c '1', @c
    '2' or @c '3'.

    If a given Compartment object instance does not provide a value for its
    'units' attribute, then the unit of measurement of that compartment's
    size is inherited from the value specified by the Model 'volumeUnits',
    'areaUnits' or 'lengthUnits' attribute, as appropriate based on the
    Compartment object's 'spatialDimensions' attribute value.  If the Model
    object does not define the relevant attribute, then there are no units
    to inherit, and all Compartment objects that do not set a value for
    their 'units' attribute then have <em>no</em> units associated with
    their compartment sizes.

    The use of three separate attributes is a carry-over from SBML
    Level&nbsp;2.  Note that it is entirely possible for a model to define a
    value for two or more of the attributes 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and
    'lengthUnits' simultaneously, because SBML models may contain
    compartments with different numbers of dimensions.


    @subsection model-l3-extentunits The 'extentUnits' attribute

    Reactions are processes that occur over time.  These processes involve
    events of some sort, where a single ``reaction event'' is one in which
    some set of entities (known as reactants, products and modifiers in
    SBML) interact, once.  The <em>extent</em> of a reaction is a measure of
    how many times the reaction has occurred, while the time derivative of
    the extent gives the instantaneous rate at which the reaction is
    occurring.  Thus, what is colloquially referred to as the 'rate of the
    reaction' is in fact equal to the rate of change of reaction extent.

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the combination of 'extentUnits' and 'timeUnits'
    defines the units of kinetic laws in SBML and establishes how the
    numerical value of each KineticLaw object's mathematical formula is
    meant to be interpreted in a model.  The units of the kinetic laws are
    taken to be 'extentUnits' divided by 'timeUnits'.

    Note that this embodies an important principle in SBML Level&nbsp;3
    models: <em>all reactions in an SBML model must have the same units</em>
    for the rate of change of extent.  In other words, the units of all
    reaction rates in the model <em>must be the same</em>.  There is only
    one global value for 'extentUnits' and one global value for 'timeUnits'.


    @subsection model-l3-convfactor The 'conversionFactor' attribute

    The attribute 'conversionFactor' in SBML Level&nbsp;3's Model object
    defines a global value inherited by all Species object instances that do
    not define separate values for their 'conversionFactor' attributes.  The
    value of this attribute must refer to a Parameter object instance
    defined in the model.  The Parameter object in question must be a
    constant; ie it must have its 'constant' attribute value set to @c
    'true'.

    If a given Species object definition does not specify a conversion
    factor via the 'conversionFactor' attribute on Species, then the species
    inherits the conversion factor specified by the Model 'conversionFactor'
    attribute.  If the Model does not define a value for this attribute,
    then there is no conversion factor to inherit.  More information about
    conversion factors is provided in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
    specification.

    @endif

    When creating fresh models programmatically, the starting point is
    typically the creation of an SBMLDocument object instance.  The
    SBMLDocument constructor accepts arguments for the SBML Level and
    Version of the model to be created.  After creating the SBMLDocument
    object, calling programs then typically call SBMLDocument.createModel()
    almost immediately, and then proceed to call the methods on the Model
    object to fill out the model's contents.

    SBMLDocument corresponds roughly to the class <i>Sbml</i> defined in the
    SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification and <i>SBML</i> in the Level&nbsp;3
    specification.  It does not have a direct correspondence in SBML
    Level&nbsp;1.  (However, to make matters simpler for applications,
    libSBML creates an SBMLDocument no matter whether the model is
    Level&nbsp;1, Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.)  In its barest form, when written out in
    XML format for (e.g.) SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the corresponding
    structure is the following:
      @verbatim
     <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4' level='2' version='4'>
       ...
     </sbml>@endverbatim

    SBMLDocument is derived from SBase, and therefore contains the usual SBase
    attributes (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3) of 'metaid' and 'sboTerm', as
    well as the subelements 'notes' and 'annotation'.  It also contains the
    attributes 'level' and 'version' indicating the Level and Version of the
    SBML data structure.  These can be accessed using the methods defined by
    the SBase class for that purpose.

    @section checking Checking consistency and adherence to SBML specifications

    One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to perform
    SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML specification
    for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses.  SBMLDocument
    provides the methods for running consistency-checking and validation
    rules on the SBML content.

    First, a brief explanation of the rationale is in order.  In libSBML
    versions up to and including the version&nbsp;3.3.x series, the
    individual methods for creating and setting attributes and other
    components were quite lenient, and allowed a caller to compose SBML
    entities that might not, in the end, represent valid SBML.  This allowed
    applications the freedom to do things such as save incomplete models
    (which is useful when models are being developed over long periods of
    time).  In the version&nbsp;4.x series, libSBML is somewhat stricter,
    but still permits structures to be created independently and the results
    to be combined in a separate step.  In all these cases, it means that a
    separate validation step is necessary when a calling program finally
    wants to finish a complete SBML document.

    The primary interface to this validation facility is SBMLDocument's
    SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency().  The former verifies the basic
    internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter
    implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the
    SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML).

    @if clike The checks performed by SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() are
    hardwired and cannot be changed by calling programs, but the validation
    performed by SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() is under program control
    using the method SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks().  Applications can
    selectively disable specific kinds of checks that they may not be
    interested in, by calling SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks() with
    appropriate parameters.
    @endif@if python The checks performed by SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() are

    selectively disable specific kinds of checks that they may not be

    @endif

    These methods have slightly different relevance depending on whether a
    model is created programmaticaly from scratch, or whether it is read in
    from a file or data stream.  The following table summarizes the possible
    scenarios.

    @section converting Converting documents between Levels and Versions of SBML

    LibSBML provides facilities for limited translation of SBML between
    Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications.  The method for doing is
    is @if java SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() @else setLevelAndVersion() @endif.  In 
    general, models can be converted upward without difficulty (e.g., from
    SBML Level&nbsp;1 to Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of
    Level&nbsp;2 to the latest Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models
    can be translated downward as well, if they do not use constructs
    specific to more advanced Levels of SBML.

    Calling @if java SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() @else SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() @endif will not @em necessarily lead
    to a successful conversion.  The method will return a boolean value
    to indicate success or failure.  Callers must check the error log (see 
    next section) attached to the SBMLDocument object after calling
    @if java SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() @else SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() @endif in order to assess whether any
    problems arose.

    If an application is interested in translating to a lower Level and/or
    Version of SBML within a Level, the following methods allow for prior
    assessment of whether there is sufficient compatibility to make a
    translation possible:
    <ul>
    <li> SBMLDocument.checkL1Compatibility(),
    <li> SBMLDocument.checkL2v1Compatibility(),
    <li> SBMLDocument.checkL2v2Compatibility(),
    <li> SBMLDocument.checkL2v3Compatibility(), 
    <li> SBMLDocument.checkL2v4Compatibility(), and
    <li> SBMLDocument.checkL3v1Compatibility().
    </ul>

    Some changes between Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 may lead to
    unexpected behaviors when attempting conversions in either direction.
    For example, SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 relaxed the requirement
    for consistency in units of measurement between expressions annd
    quantities in a model.  As a result, a model written in Version&nbsp;4,
    if converted to Version&nbsp;3 with no other changes, may fail
    validation as a Version&nbsp;3 model because Version&nbsp;3 imposed
    stricter requirements on unit consistency.

    Other changes between SBML Level 2 and Level 3 make downward conversions
    challenging.  In some cases, it means that a model converted to
    Level&nbsp;2 from Level&nbsp;3 will contain attributes that were not
    explicitly given in the Level&nbsp;3 model, because in Level&nbsp;2
    these attributes may have been optional or have default values.

    @section errors Error handling

    Upon reading a model, SBMLDocument logs any problems encountered while
    reading the model from the file or data stream.  The log contains
    objects that record diagnostic information about any notable issues that
    arose.  Whether the problems are warnings or errors, they are both
    reported through a single common interface involving the object class
    SBMLError.

    The methods SBMLDocument.getNumErrors(), @if java SBMLDocument.getError() @else SBMLDocument.getError() @endif and
    SBMLDocument.printErrors() allow callers to interact with the warnings
    or errors logged.  Alternatively, callers may retrieve the entire log as
    an SBMLErrorLog object using the method SBMLDocument.getErrorLog().
    The SBMLErrorLog object provides some alternative methods for
    interacting with the set of errors and warnings.  In either case,
    applications typically should first call SBMLDocument.getNumErrors() to
    find out if any issues have been logged after specific libSBML
    operations such as the ones discussed in the sections above.  If they
    have, then an application will should proceed to inspect the individual
    reports using either the direct interfaces on SBMLDocument or using the
    methods on the SBMLErrorLog object.

    provided in this manual in the

        Sets the SBML Level and Version of this SBMLDocument instance,
        attempting to convert the model as needed.

        This method is the principal way in libSBML to convert models between
        Levels and Versions of SBML.  Generally, models can be converted
        upward without difficulty (e.g., from SBML Level&nbsp;1 to
        Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of Level&nbsp;2 to the latest
        Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models can be translated downward
        as well, if they do not use constructs specific to more advanced
        Levels of SBML.

        Before calling this method, callers may check compatibility directly
        using the methods SBMLDocument.checkL1Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v1Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v2Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v3Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v4Compatibility(), and
        SBMLDocument.checkL3v1Compatibility().

        The valid combinations of SBML Level and Version as of this release
        of libSBML are the following: 
        <ul>
        <li> Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2
        <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1
        <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2
        <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3
        <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
        <li> Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
        </ul>

        Strict conversion applies the additional criteria that both the
        source and the target model must be consistent SBML.  Users can
        control the consistency checks that are applied using the
        SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecksForConversion() method.  If either
        the source or the potential target model have validation errors, the
        conversion is not performed.  When a strict conversion is successful,
        the underlying SBML object model is altered to reflect the new level
        and version.  Thus, information that cannot be converted
        (e.g. sboTerms) will be lost.

        @param level the desired SBML Level
         
        @param version the desired Version within the SBML Level

        @param strict boolean indicating whether to check consistency
        of both the source and target model when performing
        conversion (defaults to <code> true </code>)

        @note Calling this method will not @em necessarily lead to a successful
        conversion.  If the conversion fails, it will be logged in the error
        list associated with this SBMLDocument.  Callers should consult
        getNumErrors() to find out if the conversion succeeded without
        problems.  For conversions from Level&nbsp;2 to Level&nbsp;1, callers
        can also check the Level of the model after calling this method to
        find out whether it is Level&nbsp;1.  (If the conversion to
        Level&nbsp;1 failed, the Level of this model will be left unchanged.)

class FunctionDefinition(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %FunctionDefinition construct.

    The FunctionDefinition structure associates an identifier with a
    function definition.  This identifier can then be used as the function
    called in subsequent MathML content elsewhere in an SBML model.

    FunctionDefinition has one required attribute, 'id', to give the
    function a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
    definition can refer to it.  A FunctionDefinition instance can also have
    an optional 'name' attribute of type @c string.  Identifiers and names
    must be used according to the guidelines described in the %SBML
    specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
    specification).

    FunctionDefinition has a required 'math' subelement containing a MathML
    expression defining the function body.  The content of this element can
    only be a MathML 'lambda' element.  The 'lambda' element must begin with
    zero or more 'bvar' elements, followed by any other of the elements in
    the MathML subset allowed in SBML Level 2 @em except 'lambda' (i.e., a
    'lambda' element cannot contain another 'lambda' element).  This is the
    only place in SBML where a 'lambda' element can be used.  The function
    defined by a FunctionDefinition is only available for use in other
    MathML elements that @em follow the FunctionDefinition definition in the
    model.  (These restrictions prevent recursive and mutually-recursive
    functions from being expressed.)

    A further restriction on the content of 'math' is that it cannot contain
    references to variables other than the variables declared to the
    'lambda' itself.  That is, the contents of MathML 'ci' elements inside
    the body of the 'lambda' can only be the variables declared by its
    'bvar' elements, or the identifiers of other FunctionDefinition
    instances in the model.  This means must be written so that all
    variables or parameters used in the MathML content are passed to them
    via their function parameters.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, this restriction
    applies also to the MathML @c csymbol elements for @em time and @em
    delay; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it additionally applies to the @c csymbol
    element for @em avogadro.

    @note Function definitions (also informally known as user-defined
    functions) were introduced in SBML Level 2.  They have purposefully
    limited capabilities.  A function cannot reference parameters or other
    model quantities outside of itself; values must be passed as parameters
    to the function.  Moreover, recursive and mutually-recursive functions
    are not permitted.  The purpose of these limitations is to balance power
    against complexity of implementation.  With the restrictions as they
    are, function definitions could be implemented as textual
    substitutions&mdash;they are simply macros.  Software implementations
    therefore do not need the full function-definition machinery typically
    associated with programming languages.
    <br><br>
    Another important point to note is FunctionDefinition does not
    have a separate attribute for defining the units of the value returned
    by the function.  The units associated with the function's return value,
    when the function is called from within MathML expressions elsewhere in
    SBML, are simply the overall units of the expression in
    FunctionDefinition's 'math' subelement when applied to the arguments
    supplied in the call to the function.  Ascertaining these units requires
    performing dimensional analysis on the expression.  (Readers may wonder
    why there is no attribute.  The reason is that having a separate
    attribute for declaring the units would not only be redundant, but also
    lead to the potential for having conflicting information.  In the case
    of a conflict between the declared units and those of the value actually
    returned by the function, the only logical resolution rule would be to
    assume that the correct units are those of the expression anyway.)

    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfFunctionDefinitions construct.

    The various ListOf___ classes in %SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an %SBML model.  All are derived from
    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an %SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for %SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Unit construct.

    The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
    UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in %SBML is
    compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
    constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
    another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
    The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
    assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
    identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
    UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
    inside UnitDefinition instances.

    A Unit structure has four attributes named 'kind', 'exponent', 'scale'
    and 'multiplier'.  It represents a (possibly transformed) reference to a
    base unit.  The attribute 'kind' on Unit indicates the chosen base unit.
    Its value must be one of the text strings listed below; this list
    corresponds to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core:

    @htmlinclude base-units.html

    A few small differences exist between the Level&nbsp;3 list of base
    units and the list defined in other Level/Version combinations of SBML.
    Specifically, Levels of SBML before Level&nbsp;3 do not define @c
    avogadro; conversely, Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 defines @c Celsius,
    and Level&nbsp;1 defines @c celsius, @c meter, and @c liter, none of
    which are available in Level&nbsp;3.  In libSBML, each of the predefined
    base unit names is represented by an enumeration value @if clike in
    #UnitKind_t@else whose name begins with the characters
    <code>UNIT_KIND_</code>@endif, discussed in a separate section below.

    The attribute named 'exponent' on Unit represents an exponent on the
    unit.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute is optional and has a default
    value of @c 1 (one); in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is mandatory
    and there is no default value.  A Unit structure also has an attribute
    called 'scale'; its value must be an integer exponent for a power-of-ten
    multiplier used to set the scale of the unit.  For example, a unit
    having a 'kind' value of @c gram and a 'scale' value of @c -3 signifies
    10<sup>&nbsp;&ndash;3</sup> * gram, or milligrams.  In SBML
    Level&nbsp;2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of @c 0
    (zero), because 10<sup> 0</sup> = 1; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute
    is mandatory and has no default value.  Lastly, the attribute named
    'multiplier' can be used to multiply the unit by a real-numbered factor;
    this enables the definition of units that are not power-of-ten multiples
    of SI units.  For instance, a multiplier of 0.3048 could be used to
    define @c foot as a measure of length in terms of a @c metre.  The
    'multiplier' attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, where it has a
    default value of @c 1 (one); in SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is
    mandatory and has not default value.

    @if clike
    <h3><a class='anchor' name='UnitKind_t'>UnitKind_t</a></h3>
    @else
    <h3><a class='anchor' name='UnitKind_t'>%Unit identification codes</a></h3>
    @endif

    As discussed above, SBML defines a set of base units which serves as the
    starting point for new unit definitions.  This set of base units
    consists of the SI units and a small number of additional convenience
    units.

    @if clike Until SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3, there
    existed a data type in the SBML specifications called @c UnitKind,
    enumerating the possible SBML base units.  Although SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;3 removed this type from the language specification,
    libSBML maintains the corresponding enumeration type #UnitKind_t as a
    convenience and as a way to provide backward compatibility to previous
    SBML Level/Version specifications.  (The removal in SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;3 of the enumeration @c UnitKind was also accompanied by
    the redefinition of the data type @c UnitSId to include the previous @c
    UnitKind values as reserved symbols in the @c UnitSId space.  This
    change has no net effect on permissible models, their representation or
    their syntax.  The purpose of the change in the SBML specification was
    simply to clean up an inconsistency about the contexts in which these
    values were usable.)
    @endif@if java In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions before
    Version&nbsp;3, there existed an enumeration of units called @c
    UnitKind.  In Version&nbsp;3, this enumeration was removed and the
    identifier class @c UnitSId redefined to include the previous @c
    UnitKind values as reserved symbols.  This change has no net effect on
    permissible models, their representation or their syntax.  The purpose
    of the change in the SBML specification was simply to clean up an
    inconsistency about the contexts in which these values were usable.
    However, libSBML maintains UnitKind in the form of of a set of static
    integer constants whose names begin with the characters
    <code>UNIT_KIND_</code>.  These constants are defined in the class
    <code><a href='libsbmlConstants.html'>libsbmlConstants</a></code>.
    @endif@if python In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions before
    Version&nbsp;3, there existed an enumeration of units called @c
    UnitKind.  In Version&nbsp;3, this enumeration was removed and the
    identifier class @c UnitSId redefined to include the previous @c
    UnitKind values as reserved symbols.  This change has no net effect on
    permissible models, their representation or their syntax.  The purpose
    of the change in the SBML specification was simply to clean up an
    inconsistency about the contexts in which these values were usable.
    However, libSBML maintains UnitKind in the form of of a set of static
    integer constants whose names begin with the characters
    <code>UNIT_KIND_</code>.  These constants are defined in the class
    @link libsbml libsbml@endlink.
    @endif

    As a consequence of the fact that libSBML supports models in all Levels
    and Versions of SBML, libSBML's set of @c UNIT_KIND_ values is a union
    of all the possible base unit names defined in the different SBML
    specifications.  However, not every base unit is allowed in every
    Level+Version combination of SBML.  Note in particular the following
    exceptions:
    <ul>
    <li> The alternate spelling @c 'meter' is included in
    addition to the official SI spelling @c 'metre'.  This spelling is only
    permitted in SBML Level&nbsp;1 models.

    <li> The alternate spelling @c 'liter' is included in addition to the
    official SI spelling @c 'litre'.  This spelling is only permitted in
    SBML Level&nbsp;1 models.

    <li> The unit @c 'Celsius' is included because of its presence in
    specifications of SBML prior to SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3.

    <li> The unit @c avogadro was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3, and
    is only permitted for use in SBML Level&nbsp;3 models.
    </ul>

    @if clike The table below lists the symbols defined in the
    @c UnitKind_t enumeration, and their
    meanings. @else The table below lists the unit
    constants defined in libSBML, and their meanings. @endif

class UnitDefinition(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %UnitDefinition construct.

    Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an SBML
    model.  The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
    UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in SBML is
    compositional; for example, <em>meter second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em> is
    constructed by combining a Unit object representing <em>meter</em> with
    another Unit object representing <em>second<sup> &ndash;2</sup></em>.
    The combination is wrapped inside a UnitDefinition, which provides for
    assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination.  The
    identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the
    UnitDefinition class is the container, and Unit instances are placed
    inside UnitDefinition instances.

    Two points are worth discussing in the context of SBML units.  First,
    unit declarations in SBML models are @em optional.  The consequence of
    this is that a model must be numerically self-consistent independently
    of unit declarations, for the benefit of software tools that cannot
    interpret or manipulate units.  Unit declarations in SBML are thus more
    akin to a type of annotation; they can indicate intentions, and can be
    used by model readers for checking the consistency of the model,
    labeling simulation output, etc., but any transformations of values
    implied by different units must be incorporated @em explicitly into a
    model.

    Second, the vast majority of situations that require new SBML unit
    definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
    factors.  An example is <em>moles per litre per second</em>.  What
    distinguishes these sorts of unit definitions from more complex ones is
    that they may be expressed without the use of an additive offset from a
    zero point.  The use of offsets complicates all unit definition systems,
    yet in the domain of SBML, the real-life cases requiring offsets are few
    (and in fact, to the best of our knowledge, only involve temperature).
    Consequently, the SBML unit system has been consciously designed to
    simplify implementation of unit support for the most common cases in
    systems biology.  The cost of this simplification is to require units
    with offsets to be handled explicitly by the modeler.

    @section unitdef-summary Summary of the UnitDefinition construct

    UnitDefinition has two attributes and one subelement.  The two
    attributes are 'id' and 'name', and the subelement is ListOfUnits.

    The required attribute 'id' and optional attribute 'name' are both
    strings.  The 'id' attribute is used to give the defined unit a unique
    identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to
    it.  The 'name' attribute is intended to be used for giving the unit
    definition an optional human-readable name.  Please see the <a
    href='#unitdef-id'>next section</a> for information about the values
    permitted for 'id'.

    A UnitDefinition must contain exactly one ListOfUnits, and this list
    must contain one or more Unit definitions; see the definitions of these
    other object classes for more information about them.  The following
    example illustrates a complete unit definition (when written in XML)
    when they all the pieces are combined together.  This defines 'mmls'
    to be millimoles per litre per second.
    @code
    <listOfUnitDefinitions>
        <unitDefinition id='mmls'>
            <listOfUnits>
                <unit kind='mole'   scale='-3'/>
                <unit kind='litre'  exponent='-1'/>
                <unit kind='second' exponent='-1'/>
            </listOfUnits>
        </unitDefinition>
    </listOfUnitDefinitions>
    @endcode

    @section unitdef-id Special considerations for Unit object identifiers

    The attribute 'id' in UnitDefinition cannot be given simply any value,
    and the precise details of the values permitted differ slightly between
    Levels of SBML:
    <ul>

    <li> The 'id' of a UnitDefinition must @em not contain a value from the
    list of SBML's predefined base unit names (i.e., the strings @c gram, @c
    litre, etc.).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, this list consists of the
    following:

    @htmlinclude base-units2.html

    This list of predefined base units is nearly identical in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the exception being that Level&nbsp;2 does
    not define @c avogadro.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 (and @em only
    this Level+Version combination) provides an additional predefined unit
    name, @c Celsius, not available in Level&nbsp;3.  Finally, SBML
    Level&nbsp;1 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;3 provide two more additional
    predefined unit names, @c meter and @c liter.  This is explained in
    somewhat greater detail in the description of the Unit class.

    <li> In SBML Level&nbsp;2 (all Versions), there is an additional set of
    reserved identifiers: @c substance, @c volume, @c area, @c length, and
    @c time.  Using one of these values for the attribute 'id' of a
    UnitDefinition has the effect of redefining the model-wide default units
    for the corresponding quantities.  The list of special unit names in
    SBML Level&nbsp;2 is given in the table below:

      @htmlinclude predefined-units.html

    Also, SBML Level&nbsp;2 imposes two limitations on redefining the
    predefined unit @c substance, @c volume, @c area, @c length, and @c
    time: (1) The UnitDefinition of a predefined SBML unit can only contain
    a single Unit object within it.  (2) The value of the 'kind' attribute
    in a Unit instance must be drawn from one of the values in the second
    column of the table above.

    The special unit names @c substance, @c volume, @c area, @c length, and
    @c time are not defined by SBML Level&nbsp;3, which uses a different
    approach to setting model-wide inherited units.

    </ul>


    @section sbml-units-limits Further comments about SBML's unit definition system

    The vast majority of modeling situations requiring new SBML unit
    definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and
    factors.  An example of this might be <em>moles per litre per
    second</em>.  What distinguishes these sorts of simpler unit definitions
    from more complex ones is that they may be expressed without the use of
    an additive offset from a zero point.  The use of offsets complicates
    all unit definition systems, yet in the domain of SBML the real-life
    cases requiring offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our
    knowledge, only involve temperature).  Consequently, the SBML unit
    system has been consciously designed in a way that attempts to simplify
    implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems
    biology.

    As of SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, Unit no longer has the
    attribute called 'offset' introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;1.  It turned out that the general case involving units
    with offsets was incorrectly defined, and few (if any) developers even
    attempted to support offset-based units in their software.  In the
    development of Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, a consensus among SBML
    developers emerged that a fully generalized unit scheme is @em so
    confusing and complicated that it actually @em impedes interoperability.
    SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, Version&nbsp;3 and Version&nbsp;4 acknowledge this
    reality by reducing and simplifying the unit system, specifically by
    removing the 'offset' attribute on Unit and @c Celsius as a pre-defined
    unit.

    The following guidelines suggest methods for handling units that do
    require the use of zero offsets for their definitions:
    <ul>
    <li> <em>Handling Celsius</em>.  A model in which certain quantities are
      temperatures measured in degrees Celsius can be converted
      straightforwardly to a model in which those temperatures are in
      kelvin.  A software tool could do this by performing a straightforward
      substitution using the following relationship: <em>T<sub> kelvin</sub> =
      T<sub>Celsius</sub> + 273.15</em>.  In every mathematical formula of the
      model where a quantity (call it @em x) in degrees Celsius appears,
      replace @em x with <em>x<sub>k</sub>+ 273.15</em>, where
      <em>x<sub>k</sub></em> is now in kelvin.  An alternative approach would 
      be to use a FunctionDefinition object to define a function encapsulating this
      relationship above and then using that in the rest of the model as
      needed.  Since Celsius is a commonly-used unit, software tools could
      help users by providing users with the ability to express temperatures
      in Celsius in the tools' interfaces, and making substitutions
      automatically when writing out the SBML.

    <li> <em>Other units requiring offsets</em>.  One approach to handling
      other kinds of units is to use a FunctionDefinition to define a function
      encapsulating the necessary mathematical relationship, then
      substituting a call to this function wherever the original quantity
      appeared in the model.  For example, here is a possible definition for
      converting Fahrenheit to Celsius degrees:
      @code
    <functionDefinition id='Fahrenheit_to_kelvin'>
        <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
            <lambda>
                <bvar><ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci></bvar>
                <apply>
                    <divide/>
                    <apply>
                        <plus/>
                        <ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci>
                        <cn> 459.67 </cn>
                    </apply>
                    <cn> 1.8 </cn>
                </apply>
            </lambda>
        </math>
    </functionDefinition>
      @endcode
        
    <li> An alternative approach not requiring the use of function definitions
      is to use an AssignmentRule for each variable in Fahrenheit units.
      The AssignmentRule could compute the conversion from Fahrenheit to
      (say) kelvin, assign its value to a variable (in Kelvin units), and
      then that variable could be used elsewhere in the model.

    <li> Still another approach is to rewrite the mathematical formulas of a
      model to directly incorporate the conversion formula wherever the
      original quantity appeared.
    </ul>

    Please consult the SBML specifications for more information about this
    and other issues involving units.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for

    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about

    LibSBML implementation of SBML's Level&nbsp;2's %CompartmentType construct.

    SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide the <em>compartment
    type</em> as a grouping construct that can be used to establish a
    relationship between multiple Compartment objects.  A CompartmentType
    object only has an identity, and this identity can only be used to
    indicate that particular Compartment objects in the model belong to this
    type.  This may be useful for conveying a modeling intention, such as
    when a model contains many similar compartments, either by their
    biological function or the reactions they carry.  Without a compartment
    type construct, it would be impossible within SBML itself to indicate
    that all of the compartments share an underlying conceptual relationship
    because each SBML compartment must be given a unique and separate
    identity.  Compartment types have no mathematical meaning in
    SBML&mdash;they have no effect on a model's mathematical interpretation.
    Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
    CompartmentType definitions and references to them in a model.

    There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
    compartment types.  One CompartmentType instance cannot be the subtype
    of another CompartmentType instance; SBML provides no means of defining
    such relationships.

    As with other major structures in SBML, CompartmentType has a mandatory
    attribute, 'id', used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The
    identifier must be a text %string conforming to the identifer syntax
    permitted in SBML.  CompartmentType also has an optional 'name'
    attribute, of type @c string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g.,
    Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification).

    CompartmentType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
    available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

        consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
        at the time of creation of a CompartmentType is an important aid to
        producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and
        Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to

        <pre class='signature'>CompartmentType(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)</pre>

        Creates a new CompartmentType using the given SBMLNamespaces object
        @p sbmlns.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
        A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
        object constructors such as this one when needed.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a CompartmentType is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
        method setId(@if java String id@endif).

        @param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

        @note Upon the addition of a CompartmentType object to an SBMLDocument
        (e.g., using Model.addCompartmentType()), the SBML XML namespace of

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's %SpeciesType construct.

    The term @em species @em type refers to reacting entities independent of
    location.  These include simple ions (e.g., protons, calcium), simple
    molecules (e.g., glucose, ATP), large molecules (e.g., RNA,
    polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.

    SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 provide an explicit
    SpeciesType class of object to enable Species objects of the same type
    to be related together.  SpeciesType is a conceptual construct; the
    existence of SpeciesType objects in a model has no effect on the model's
    numerical interpretation.  Except for the requirement for uniqueness of
    species/species type combinations located in compartments, simulators
    and other numerical analysis software may ignore SpeciesType definitions
    and references to them in a model.

    There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
    species types.  One SpeciesType object cannot be the subtype of another
    SpeciesType object; SBML provides no means of defining such
    relationships.

    As with other major structures in SBML, SpeciesType has a mandatory
    attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier.  The
    identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
    permitted in SBML.  SpeciesType also has an optional 'name' attribute,
    of type @c string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the
    guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in
    the Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 specification).

    SpeciesType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
    available in SBML Level&nbsp;1 nor in Level&nbsp;3.

        consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
        at the time of creation of a SpeciesType is an important aid to
        producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and
        Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to

        <pre class='signature'>SpeciesType(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)</pre>

        Creates a new SpeciesType using the given SBMLNamespaces object
        @p sbmlns.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
        A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
        object constructors such as this one when needed.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a SpeciesType object is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
        method SBase.setId().

        @param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

        @note Upon the addition of a SpeciesType object to an SBMLDocument
        (e.g., using Model.addSpeciesType()),
        the SBML XML namespace of the document @em overrides the value used
        when creating the SpeciesType object via this constructor.  This is
        necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.

    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfSpeciesTypes construct.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Compartment(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Compartment construct.

    A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are
    located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual
    structures inside or outside of a biological cell.

    It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the
    overall definition of Model, every species in an SBML model must be
    located in a compartment.  This in turn means that if a model defines
    any species, the model must also define at least one compartment.  The
    reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore
    must exist @em somewhere.  Compartments represent the @em somewhere.

    Compartment has one required attribute, 'id', to give the compartment a
    unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can
    refer to it.  A compartment can also have an optional 'name' attribute
    of type @c string.  Identifiers and names must be used according to the
    guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    Compartment also has an optional attribute 'spatialDimensions' that is
    used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the
    compartment.  Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer
    values of 'spatialDimensions' of @c 3 (i.e., a three-dimensional
    compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional
    compartment, a surface), or @c 1 (a one-dimensional compartment, a
    line).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the type of this attribute is @c double,
    there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the
    'spatialDimensions' attribute, and there are no default values.  In SBML
    Level&nbsp;2, the value must be a positive @c integer, and the default
    value is @c 3; the permissible values in SBML Level&nbsp;2 are @c 3, @c
    2, @c 1, and @c 0 (for a point).

    Another optional attribute on Compartment is 'size', representing the
    @em initial total size of that compartment in the model.  The 'size'
    attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume (if
    the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the
    compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is
    one-dimensional).  There is no default value of compartment size in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.  In particular, a missing 'size' value
    <em>does not imply that the compartment size is 1</em>.  (This is unlike
    the definition of compartment 'volume' in SBML Level&nbsp;1.)  When the
    compartment's 'spatialDimensions' attribute does not have a value of @c
    0, a missing value of 'size' for a given compartment signifies that the
    value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
    determined by an InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule or
    RateRule elsewhere in the model.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there are
    additional special requirements on the values of 'size'; we discuss them
    in a <a href='#comp-l2'>separate section below</a>.

    The units associated with a compartment's 'size' attribute value may be
    set using the optional attribute 'units'.  The rules for setting and
    using compartment size units differ between SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
    Level&nbsp;3, and are discussed separately below.

    Finally, the optional Compartment attribute named 'constant' is used to
    indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after simulation
    begins.  A value of @c true indicates the compartment's 'size' cannot be
    changed by any other construct except InitialAssignment; a value of @c
    false indicates the compartment's 'size' can be changed by other
    constructs in SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there is an additional
    explicit restriction that if 'spatialDimensions'=@c '0', the value
    cannot be changed by InitialAssignment either.  Further, in
    Level&nbsp;2, 'constant' has a default value of @c true.  In SBML
    Level&nbsp;3, there is no default value for the 'constant' attribute.


    @section comp-l2 Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;2

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the default units of compartment size, and the
    kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute 'units', interact with
    the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment.  The value of the
    'units' attribute of a Compartment object must be one of the base units
    (see Unit), or the predefined unit identifiers @c volume, @c area, @c
    length or @c dimensionless, or a new unit defined by a UnitDefinition
    object in the enclosing Model, subject to the restrictions detailed in
    the following table:

    @htmlinclude compartment-size-restrictions.html 

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the
    'units' attribute or (if 'units' is not set) the default value listed in
    the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has
    a 'spatialDimensions' value greater than @c 0:
    <ul>
    <li> The value of the 'units' attribute is used as the units of the
    compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical
    quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.

    <li> The @c math element of an AssignmentRule or InitialAssignment
    referring to this compartment must have identical units.

    <li> In RateRule objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's
    size, the units of the rule's @c math element must be identical to the
    compartment's 'units' attribute divided by the default @em time units.
    (In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size
    are <em>compartment size</em>/<em>time</em> units.

    <li> When a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
    density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration
    value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula @em substance/@em
    size) are those indicated by the value of the 'units' attribute on the
    compartment in which the species is located.
    </ul>

    Compartments with 'spatialDimensions'=@c 0 require special treatment in
    this framework.  As implied above, the 'size' attribute must not have a
    value on an SBML Level&nbsp;2 Compartment object if the
    'spatialDimensions' attribute has a value of @c 0.  An additional
    related restriction is that the 'constant' attribute must default to or
    be set to @c true if the value of the 'spatialDimensions' attribute is
    @c 0, because a zero-dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.

    If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a
    compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical
    formulas?  The answer is that such a compartment's identifier should not
    appear in mathematical formulas in the first place&mdash;it has no
    value, and its value cannot change.  Note also that a zero-dimensional
    compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be
    described in terms of amounts, not spatially-dependent measures such as
    concentration.  Since SBML KineticLaw formulas are already in terms of
    @em substance/@em time and not (say) @em concentration/@em time, volume
    or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in
    zero-dimensional compartments.

    Finally, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, each compartment in a
    model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular
    compartment @em type.  The optional attribute 'compartmentType' is used
    identify the compartment type represented by the Compartment structure.
    The 'compartmentType' attribute's value must be the identifier of a
    CompartmentType instance defined in the model.  If the 'compartmentType'
    attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a
    unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no
    other compartment can belong to that compartment type.  The values of
    'compartmentType' attributes on compartments have no effect on the
    numerical interpretation of a model.  Simulators and other numerical
    analysis software may ignore 'compartmentType' attributes.  The
    'compartmentType' attribute and the CompartmentType class of objects are
    not present in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core nor in SBML Level&nbsp;1.


    @section comp-l3 Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;3

    One difference between SBML Level&nbsp;3 and lower Levels of SBML is
    that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the
    'spatialDimensions' attribute, and there is no default value defined for
    the attribute.  The value of 'spatialDimensions' does not have to be an
    integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing
    structures with fractal dimensions.

    The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter
    into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the
    numerical interpretation of a model.  However, the value of
    'spatialDimensions' @em does affect the interpretation of the units
    associated with a compartment's size.  Specifically, the value of
    'spatialDimensions' is used to select among the Model attributes
    'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and 'lengthUnits' when a Compartment object
    does not define a value for its 'units' attribute.

    The 'units' attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in
    a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement
    specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing Model object
    instance.  The applicable attribute on Model depends on the value of the
    compartment's 'spatialDimensions' attribute; the relationship is shown
    in the table below.  If the Model object does not define the relevant
    attribute ('volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or 'lengthUnits') for a given
    'spatialDimensions' value, the unit associated with that Compartment
    object's size is undefined.  If @em both 'spatialDimensions' and 'units'
    are left unset on a given Compartment object instance, then no unit can
    be chosen from among the Model's 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or
    'lengthUnits' attributes (even if the Model instance provides values for
    those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them and
    there is no default value of 'spatialDimensions'.  Leaving the units of
    compartments' sizes undefined in an SBML model does not render the model
    invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend
    that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment
    sizes.

    @htmlinclude compartment-size-recommendations.html

    The unit of measurement associated with a compartment's size, as defined
    by the 'units' attribute or (if 'units' is not set) the inherited value
    from Model according to the table above, is used in the following ways:

    <ul>

    <li> When the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical
    quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML, it represents
    the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is
    the value of the 'units' attribute.

    <li> When a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
    density, the unit associated with the spatial size portion of the
    concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the formula
    <em>amount</em>/<em>size</em>) is specified by the value of the 'units'
    attribute on the compartment in which the species is located.

    <li> The 'math' elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
    EventAssignment objects setting the value of the compartment size
    should all have the same units as the unit associated with the
    compartment's size.

    <li> In a RateRule object that defines a rate of change for a
    compartment's size, the unit of the rule's 'math' element should be
    identical to the compartment's 'units' attribute divided by the
    model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.  (In other words, {<em>unit of
    compartment size</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.)

    </ul>


    @section comp-other Other aspects of Compartment

    In SBML Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2, Compartment has an optional
    attribute named 'outside', whose value can be the identifier of another
    Compartment object defined in the enclosing Model object.  Doing so
    means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it.  This
    enables the representation of simple topological relationships between
    compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the
    information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments).  It is
    worth noting that in SBML, there is no relationship between compartment
    sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the 'outside'
    attribute.  The size of a given compartment does not in any sense
    include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their
    'outside' attributes.  In other words, if a compartment @em B has the
    identifier of compartment @em A as its 'outside' attribute value, the
    size of @em A does not include the size of @em B.  The compartment sizes
    are separate.

    In Level&nbsp;2, there are two restrictions on the 'outside' attribute.
    First, because a compartment with 'spatialDimensions' of @c 0 has no
    size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other
    compartment @em except compartments that @em also have
    'spatialDimensions' values of @c 0.  Second, the directed graph formed
    by representing Compartment structures as vertexes and the 'outside'
    attribute values as edges must be acyclic.  The latter condition is
    imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself.  In
    the absence of a value for 'outside', compartment definitions in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each
    other.

        This method has multiple variants that differ in the arguments they accept.  Each is described separately below.

        <hr>
        Method variant with the following signature:
        <pre class='signature'>Compartment(long level, long version)</pre>

        Creates a new Compartment using the given SBML @p level and @p version
        values.

        @param level a long integer, the SBML Level to assign to this Compartment

        @param version a long integer, the SBML Version to assign to this
        Compartment

        @note Upon the addition of a Compartment object to an SBMLDocument
        (e.g., using Model.addCompartment()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
        and XML namespace of the document @em override the values used
        when creating the Compartment object via this constructor.  This is
        necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
        Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
        of a Compartment is an important aid to producing valid SBML.
        Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it
        is valid to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it
        is valid to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.
          

        <hr>
        Method variant with the following signature:
        <pre class='signature'>Compartment(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)</pre>

        Creates a new Compartment using the given SBMLNamespaces object 
        @p sbmlns.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
        A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
        object constructors such as this one when needed.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a Compartment is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
        method @if java Compartment.setId()@else setId()@endif.

        @param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

        @note Upon the addition of a Compartment object to an SBMLDocument
        (e.g., using Model.addCompartment()), the SBML XML namespace of the
        document @em overrides the value used when creating the Compartment
        object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML
        document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to
        supply the values at the time of creation of a Compartment is an
        important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML
        Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular
        value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an
        existing SBMLDocument.

        Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units

        Compartments in SBML have an attribute ('units') for declaring the
        units of measurement intended for the value of the compartment's size.
        In the absence of a value given for this attribute, the units are
        inherited from values either defined on the enclosing Model (in SBML
        Level&nbsp;3) or in defaults (in SBML Level&nbsp;2).  This method
        returns a UnitDefinition object based on how this compartment's units
        are interpreted according to the relevant SBML guidelines, or it
        returns @c None if no units have been declared and no defaults are
        defined by the relevant SBML specification.

        Note that unit declarations for Compartment objects are specified in
        terms of the @em identifier of a unit (e.g., using
        @if java Compartment.setUnits()@else setUnits()@endif), but
        @em this method returns a UnitDefinition object, not a unit
        identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
        UnitDefinition.  For SBML Level&nbsp;2 models, it will do this even

        Level&nbsp;2 unit identifiers @c 'substance', @c 'volume', @c 'area',

    LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's %ListOfCompartments construct.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about

class Species(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Species construct.

    A @em species in SBML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are
    considered indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the
    model, (b) participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a specific
    @em compartment.  The SBML Species object class is intended to represent
    these pools.

    As with other major constructs in SBML, Species has a mandatory
    attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier in the
    model.  The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer
    syntax permitted in SBML.  Species also has an optional 'name'
    attribute, of type @c string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    The required attribute 'compartment' is used to identify the compartment
    in which the species is located.  The attribute's value must be the
    identifier of an existing Compartment object.  It is important to note
    that there is no default value for the 'compartment' attribute on
    Species; every species in an SBML model must be assigned a compartment
    @em explicitly.  (This also implies that every model with one or more
    Species objects must define at least one Compartment object.)


    @section species-amounts The initial amount and concentration of a species

    The optional attributes 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration', both
    having a data type of @c double, can be used to set the @em initial
    quantity of the species in the compartment where the species is located.
    These attributes are mutually exclusive; i.e., <em>only one</em> can
    have a value on any given instance of a Species object.  Missing
    'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration' values implies that their
    values either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
    determined by an InitialAssignment or other SBML construct elsewhere in
    the model.

    A species' initial quantity in SBML is set by the 'initialAmount' or
    'initialConcentration' attribute exactly once.  If the 'constant'
    attribute is @c true, then the value of the species' quantity is fixed
    and cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment.  These methods
    differ in that the 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration' attributes
    can only be used to set the species quantity to a literal floating-point
    number, whereas the use of an InitialAssignment object allows the value
    to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression (which, thanks to
    MathML's expressiveness, may evaluate to a rational number).  If the
    species' 'constant' attribute is @c false, the species' quantity value
    may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed by AssignmentRule
    or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for <em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be
    changed by a RateRule, Event objects, and as a result of being a
    reactant or product in one or more Reaction objects.  (However, some
    constructs are mutually exclusive; see the SBML specifications for the
    precise details.)  It is not an error to define 'initialAmount' or
    'initialConcentration' on a species and also redefine the value using an
    InitialAssignment, but the 'initialAmount' or 'initialConcentration'
    setting in that case is ignored.  The SBML specifications provide
    additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules and
    values for simulation time <em>t</em> <= <em>0</em>.

    SBML Level&nbsp;2 additionally stipulates that in cases where a species'
    compartment has a 'spatialDimensions' value of @c 0 (zero), the species
    cannot have a value for 'initialConcentration' because the concepts of
    concentration and density break down when a container has zero
    dimensions.

    @section species-units The units of a species' amount or concentration

    When the attribute 'initialAmount' is set, the unit of measurement
    associated with the value of 'initialAmount' is specified by the Species
    attribute 'substanceUnits'.  When the 'initialConcentration' attribute
    is set, the unit of measurement associated with this concentration value
    is {<em>unit of amount</em>} divided by {<em>unit of size</em>}, where
    the {<em>unit of amount</em>} is specified by the Species
    'substanceUnits' attribute, and the {<em>unit of size</em>} is specified
    by the 'units' attribute of the Compartment object in which the species
    is located.  Note that in either case, a unit of <em>amount</em> is
    involved and determined by the 'substanceUnits' attribute.  Note
    <strong>these two attributes alone do not determine the units of the
    species when the species identifier appears in a mathematical
    expression</strong>; <em>that</em> aspect is determined by the attribute
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' discussed below.

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3, if the 'substanceUnits' attribute is not set on a
    given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
    species is inherited from the 'substanceUnits' attribute on the
    enclosing Model object instance.  If that attribute on Model is not set
    either, then the unit associated with the species' quantity is
    undefined.

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2, if the 'substanceUnits' attribute is not set on a
    given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
    species is taken from the predefined SBML unit identifier @c
    'substance'.  The value assigned to 'substanceUnits' must be chosen from
    one of the following possibilities: one of the base unit identifiers
    defined in SBML, the built-in unit identifier @c 'substance', or the
    identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the
    enclosing Model object.  The chosen units for 'substanceUnits' must be
    be @c 'dimensionless', @c 'mole', @c 'item', @c 'kilogram', @c 'gram',
    or units derived from these.

    As noted at the beginning of this section, simply setting
    'initialAmount' or 'initialConcentration' alone does @em not determine
    whether a species identifier represents an amount or a concentration
    when it appears elsewhere in an SBML model.  The role of the attribute
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' is to indicate whether the units of the species,
    when the species identifier appears in mathematical formulas, are
    intended to be concentration or amount.  The attribute takes on a
    boolean value.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute has no default value
    and must always be set in a model; in SBML Level&nbsp;2, it has a
    default value of @c false.

    The <em>units of the species</em> are used in the following ways:
    <ul>
    <li> When the species' identifier appears in a MathML formula, it
    represents the species' quantity, and the unit of measurement associated
    with the quantity is as described above.

    <li> The 'math' elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
    EventAssignment objects referring to this species should all have the
    same units as the unit of measurement associated with the species
    quantity.

    <li> In a RateRule object that defines the rate of change of the
    species' quantity, the unit associated with the rule's 'math' element
    should be equal to the unit of the species' quantity divided by the
    model-wide unit of <em>time</em>; in other words, {<em>unit of species
    quantity</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.

    </ul>


    @section species-constant The 'constant' and 'boundaryCondition' attributes

    The Species object class has two boolean attributes named 'constant' and
    'boundaryCondition', used to indicate whether and how the quantity of
    that species can vary during a simulation.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 they
    are optional; in SBML Level&nbsp;3 they are mandatory.  The following
    table shows how to interpret the combined values of these attributes.

    @htmlinclude species-boundarycondition.html

    By default, when a species is a product or reactant of one or more
    reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions.  In SBML, it
    is possible to indicate that a given species' quantity is <em>not</em>
    determined by the set of reactions even when that species occurs as a
    product or reactant; i.e., the species is on the <em>boundary</em> of
    the reaction system, and its quantity is not determined by the
    reactions.  The boolean attribute 'boundaryCondition' can be used to
    indicate this.  A value of @c false indicates that the species @em is
    part of the reaction system.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a
    default value of @c false, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no
    default.

    The 'constant' attribute indicates whether the species' quantity can be
    changed at all, regardless of whether by reactions, rules, or constructs
    other than InitialAssignment.  A value of @c false indicates that the
    species' quantity can be changed.  (This is also a common value because
    the purpose of most simulations is precisely to calculate changes in
    species quantities.)  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a default
    value of @c false, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no default.  Note
    that the initial quantity of a species can be set by an
    InitialAssignment irrespective of the value of the 'constant' attribute.

    In practice, a 'boundaryCondition' value of @c true means a differential
    equation derived from the reaction definitions should not be generated
    for the species.  However, the species' quantity may still be changed by
    AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and InitialAssignment
    constructs if its 'constant' attribute is @c false.  Conversely, if the
    species' 'constant' attribute is @c true, then its value cannot be
    changed by anything except InitialAssignment.

    A species having 'boundaryCondition'=@c false and 'constant'=@c false
    can appear as a product and/or reactant of one or more reactions in the
    model.  If the species is a reactant or product of a reaction, it must
    @em not also appear as the target of any AssignmentRule or RateRule
    object in the model.  If instead the species has 'boundaryCondition'=@c
    false and 'constant'=@c true, then it cannot appear as a reactant or
    product, or as the target of any AssignmentRule, RateRule or
    EventAssignment object in the model.


    @section species-l2-convfactor The conversionFactor attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;3

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3, Species has an additional optional attribute,
    'conversionFactor', that defines a conversion factor that applies to a
    particular species.  The value must be the identifier of a Parameter
    object instance defined in the model.  That Parameter object must be a
    constant, meaning its 'constant' attribute must be set to @c true.
    If a given Species object definition defines a value for its
    'conversionFactor' attribute, it takes precedence over any factor
    defined by the Model object's 'conversionFactor' attribute.

    The unit of measurement associated with a species' quantity can be
    different from the unit of extent of reactions in the model.  SBML
    Level&nbsp;3 avoids implicit unit conversions by providing an explicit
    way to indicate any unit conversion that might be required.  The use of
    a conversion factor in computing the effects of reactions on a species'
    quantity is explained in detail in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 specification
    document.  Because the value of the 'conversionFactor' attribute is the
    identifier of a Parameter object, and because parameters can have units
    attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent units to
    species units can be completely specified using this approach.

    Note that the unit conversion factor is <strong>only applied when
    calculating the effect of a reaction on a species</strong>.  It is not
    used in any rules or other SBML constructs that affect the species, and
    it is also not used when the value of the species is referenced in a
    mathematical expression.


    @section species-l2-type The speciesType attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4, each species in a model
    may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular species type.
    The optional attribute 'speciesType' is used to identify the species
    type of the chemical entities that make up the pool represented by the
    Species objects.  The attribute's value must be the identifier of an
    existing SpeciesType object in the model.  If the 'speciesType'
    attribute is not present on a particular species definition, it means
    the pool contains chemical entities of a type unique to that pool; in
    effect, a virtual species type is assumed for that species, and no other
    species can belong to that species type.  The value of 'speciesType'
    attributes on species have no effect on the numerical interpretation of
    a model; simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
    'speciesType' attributes.

    There can be only one species of a given species type in any given
    compartment of a model.  More specifically, for all Species objects
    having a value for the 'speciesType' attribute, the pair
    <center>
    ('speciesType' attribute value, 'compartment' attribute value)
    </center>

    must be unique across the set of all Species object in a model.


    @section species-other The spatialSizeUnits attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1&ndash;2

    In versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 before Version&nbsp;3, the class
    Species included an attribute called 'spatialSizeUnits', which allowed
    explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.  LibSBML
    retains this attribute for compatibility with older definitions of
    Level&nbsp;2, but its use is strongly discouraged because many software
    tools do no properly interpret this unit declaration and it is
    incompatible with all SBML specifications after Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;3.


    @section species-math Additional considerations for interpreting the numerical value of a species

    Species are unique in SBML in that they have a kind of duality: a
    species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning, a
    count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration or
    density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size).  The previous
    sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when it is
    referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other SBML
    constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a species
    when the compartment in which it is located changes in size.

    When a species definition has a 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value
    of @c false and the size of the compartment in which the species is
    located changes, the default in SBML is to assume that it is the
    concentration that must be updated to account for the size change.  This
    follows from the principle that, all other things held constant, if a
    compartment simply changes in size, the size change does not in itself
    cause an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any species
    in that compartment.  In a sense, the default is that the @em amount of
    a species is preserved across compartment size changes.  Upon such size
    changes, the value of the concentration or density must be recalculated
    from the simple relationship <em>concentration = amount / size</em> if
    the value of the concentration is needed (for example, if the species
    identifier appears in a mathematical formula or is otherwise referenced
    in an SBML construct).  There is one exception: if the species' quantity
    is determined by an AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, or an
    EventAssignment and the species has a 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute
    value of @c false, it means that the <em>concentration</em> is assigned
    by the rule or event; in that case, the <em>amount</em> must be
    calculated when the compartment size changes.  (Events also require
    additional care in this situation, because an event with multiple
    assignments could conceivably reassign both a species quantity and a
    compartment size simultaneously.  Please refer to the SBML
    specifications for the details.)

    Note that the above only matters if a species has a
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of @c false, meaning that the
    species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the identifier
    appears in a mathematical formula.  If instead the attribute's value is
    @c true, then the identifier of the species <em>always</em> stands for
    an amount wherever it appears in a mathematical formula or is referenced
    by an SBML construct.  In that case, there is never a question about
    whether an assignment or event is meant to affect the amount or
    concentration: it is always the amount.

    A particularly confusing situation can occur when the species has
    'constant' attribute value of @c true in combination with a
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of @c false.  Suppose this
    species is given a value for 'initialConcentration'.  Does a 'constant'
    value of @c true mean that the concentration is held constant if the
    compartment size changes?  No; it is still the amount that is kept
    constant across a compartment size change.  The fact that the species
    was initialized using a concentration value is irrelevant.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a Species is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
        method Species.setId().

        @param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

        @note Upon the addition of a Species object to an SBMLDocument (e.g.,
        using Model.addSpecies()), the SBML XML namespace of the document @em
        overrides the value used when creating the Species object via this
        constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a
        consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
        at the time of creation of a Species is an important aid to producing
        valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        determine whether it is valid to assign a particular value to an
        attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an existing
        SBMLDocument.

        Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units

        Species in SBML have an attribute ('substanceUnits') for declaring the
        units of measurement intended for the species' amount or concentration
        (depending on which one applies).  In the absence of a value given for
        'substanceUnits', the units are taken from the enclosing Model's
        definition of @c 'substance' or @c 'substance'/<em>(size of the
        compartment)</em> in which the species is located, or finally, if
        these are not redefined by the Model, the relevant SBML default units
        for those quantities.  Following that procedure, the method
        @if java Species.getDerivedUnitDefinition()@else getDerivedUnitDefinition()@endif
        returns a UnitDefinition based on the
        interpreted units of this species's amount or concentration.

        Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
        on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
        been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
        unit analysis is not possible and this method will return @c None.

        Note also that unit declarations for Species are in terms of the @em
        identifier of a unit, but this method returns a UnitDefinition object,
        not a unit identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
        UnitDefinition.  Callers may find this particularly useful when used
        in conjunction with the helper methods on UnitDefinition for comparing
        different UnitDefinition objects.

        In SBML Level&nbsp;2 specifications prior to Version&nbsp;3, Species

    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Parameter(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Parameter construct.

    A Parameter is used in SBML to define a symbol associated with a value;
    this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a model.  By
    default, parameters have constant value for the duration of a
    simulation, and for this reason are called @em parameters instead of @em
    variables in SBML, although it is crucial to understand that <em>SBML
    parameters represent both concepts</em>.  Whether a given SBML
    parameter is intended to be constant or variable is indicated by the
    value of its 'constant' attribute.

    SBML's Parameter has a required attribute, 'id', that gives the
    parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
    definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
    'name' attribute of type @c string.  Identifiers and names must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    The optional attribute 'value' determines the value (of type @c double)
    assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for 'value' implies that
    the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
    or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of measurement
    associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the
    optional attribute 'units'.  Here we only mention briefly some notable
    points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult
    the SBML specification documents for more information:
    <ul>

    <li> In SBML Level&nbsp;3, there are no constraints on the units that
    can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to
    inherit from the enclosing Model object (unlike the case for, e.g.,
    Species and Compartment).

    <li> In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the value assigned to the parameter's 'units'
    attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one of
    the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
    identifiers @c 'substance', @c 'time', @c 'volume', @c 'area' or @c
    'length'; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit
    definitions in the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints
    on the units that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default
    units for parameters.
    </ul>

    The Parameter structure has another boolean attribute named 'constant'
    that is used to indicate whether the parameter's value can vary during a
    simulation.  (In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is mandatory and must
    be given a value; in SBML Levels below Level&nbsp;3, the attribute is
    optional.)  A value of @c true indicates the parameter's value cannot be
    changed by any construct except InitialAssignment.  Conversely, if the
    value of 'constant' is @c false, other constructs in SBML, such as rules
    and events, can change the value of the parameter.

    SBML Level&nbsp;3 uses a separate object class, LocalParameter, for
    parameters that are local to a Reaction's KineticLaw.  In Levels prior
    to SBML Level&nbsp;3, the Parameter class is used both for definitions
    of global parameters, as well as reaction-local parameters stored in a
    list within KineticLaw objects.  Parameter objects that are local to a
    reaction (that is, those defined within the KineticLaw structure of a
    Reaction) cannot be changed by rules and therefore are <em>implicitly
    always constant</em>; consequently, in SBML Level&nbsp;2, parameter
    definitions within Reaction structures should @em not have their
    'constant' attribute set to @c false.

    What if a global parameter has its 'constant' attribute set to @c false,
    but the model does not contain any rules, events or other constructs
    that ever change its value over time?  Although the model may be
    suspect, this situation is not strictly an error.  A value of @c false
    for 'constant' only indicates that a parameter @em can change value, not
    that it @em must.

    As with all other major SBML components, Parameter is derived from
    SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on Parameter.

    @note The use of the term @em parameter in SBML sometimes leads to
    confusion among readers who have a particular notion of what something
    called 'parameter' should be.  It has been the source of heated debate,
    but despite this, no one has yet found an adequate replacement term that
    does not have different connotations to different people and hence leads
    to confusion among @em some subset of users.  Perhaps it would have been
    better to have two constructs, one called @em constants and the other
    called @em variables.  The current approach in SBML is simply more
    parsimonious, using a single Parameter construct with the boolean flag
    'constant' indicating which flavor it is.  In any case, readers are
    implored to look past their particular definition of a @em parameter and
    simply view SBML's Parameter as a single mechanism for defining both
    constants and (additional) variables in a model.  (We write @em
    additional because the species in a model are usually considered to be
    the central variables.)  After all, software tools are not required to
    expose to users the actual names of particular SBML constructs, and
    thus tools can present to their users whatever terms their designers
    feel best matches their target audience.

        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
        A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
        object constructors such as this one when needed.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a Parameter is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor if no identifier is provided as an argument.  Setting the
        identifier can be accomplished using the method
        @if java setId(String id)@else setId()@endif.

    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;3's %LocalParameter construct.

    LocalParameter has been introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3 to serve as the
    object class for parameter definitions that are intended to be local to
    a Reaction.  Objects of class LocalParameter never appear at the Model
    level; they are always contained within ListOfLocalParameters lists
    which are in turn contained within KineticLaw objects.

    Like its global Parameter counterpart, the LocalParameter object class
    is used to define a symbol associated with a value; this symbol can then
    be used in a model's mathematical formulas (and specifically, for
    LocalParameter, reaction rate formulas).  Unlike Parameter, the
    LocalParameter class does not have a 'constant' attribute: local
    parameters within reactions are @em always constant.

    LocalParameter has one required attribute, 'id', to give the
    parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
    definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
    'name' attribute of type @c string.  Identifiers and names must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    The optional attribute 'value' determines the value (of type @c double)
    assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for 'value' implies that
    the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
    or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of measurement
    associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the
    optional attribute 'units'.  Here we only mention briefly some notable
    points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult
    the SBML specification documents for more information:
    <ul>

    <li> In SBML Level&nbsp;3, there are no constraints on the units that
    can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to
    inherit from the enclosing Model object.

    <li> In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the value assigned to the parameter's 'units'
    attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one of
    the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
    identifiers @c 'substance', @c 'time', @c 'volume', @c 'area' or @c
    'length'; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit
    definitions in the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints
    on the units that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default
    units for local parameters.
    </ul>

    As with all other major SBML components, LocalParameter is derived from
    SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on LocalParameter.

    @warning LibSBML derives LocalParameter from Parameter; however, this
    does not precisely match the object hierarchy defined by SBML
    Level&nbsp;3, where LocalParameter is derived directly from SBase and not
    Parameter.  We believe this arrangement makes it easier for libSBML
    users to program applications that work with both SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
    SBML Level&nbsp;3, but programmers should also keep in mind this
    difference exists.  A side-effect of libSBML's scheme is that certain
    methods on LocalParameter that are inherited from Parameter do not
    actually have relevance to LocalParameter objects.  An example of this
    is the methods pertaining to Parameter's attribute 'constant'
    (i.e., isSetConstant(), setConstant(), and getConstant()).

        LocalParameter.

        consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values
        at the time of creation of a LocalParameter is an important aid to
        producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML Level and

        Creates a new LocalParameter object with the given SBMLNamespaces
        object @p sbmlns.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
        A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
        object constructors such as this one when needed.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a LocalParameter is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor if no identifier is provided as an argument.  Setting the
        identifier can be accomplished using the method
        @if java setId(String id)@else setId()@endif.

        @param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

        @note Upon the addition of a LocalParameter object to an SBMLDocument

        ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless,

class InitialAssignment(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %InitialAssignment construct.

    SBML Level 2 Versions 2&ndash;4 and SBML Level&nbsp;3 provide two ways of assigning initial
    values to entities in a model.  The simplest and most basic is to set
    the values of the appropriate attributes in the relevant components; for
    example, the initial value of a model parameter (whether it is a
    constant or a variable) can be assigned by setting its 'value' attribute
    directly in the model definition.  However, this approach is not
    suitable when the value must be calculated, because the initial value
    attributes on different components such as species, compartments, and
    parameters are single values and not mathematical expressions.  In those
    situations, the InitialAssignment construct can be used; it permits the
    calculation of the value of a constant or the initial value of a
    variable from the values of @em other quantities in a model.

    As explained below, the provision of InitialAssignment does not mean
    that models necessarily must use this construct when defining initial
    values of quantities in a model.  If a value can be set directly using
    the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then that
    approach may be more efficient and more portable to other software
    tools.  InitialAssignment should be used when the other mechanism is
    insufficient for the needs of a particular model.

    The InitialAssignment construct has some similarities to AssignmentRule.
    The main differences are: (a) an InitialAssignment can set the value of
    a constant whereas an AssignmentRule cannot, and (b) unlike
    AssignmentRule, an InitialAssignment definition only applies up to and
    including the beginning of simulation time, i.e., <em>t <= 0</em>,
    while an AssignmentRule applies at all times.

    InitialAssignment has a required attribute, 'symbol', whose value must
    follow the guidelines for identifiers described in the %SBML
    specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
    specification).  The value of this attribute in an InitialAssignment
    object can be the identifier of a Compartment, Species or global
    Parameter elsewhere in the model.  The InitialAssignment defines the
    initial value of the constant or variable referred to by the 'symbol'
    attribute.  (The attribute's name is 'symbol' rather than 'variable'
    because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in a
    model.)  Note that an initial assignment cannot be made to reaction
    identifiers, that is, the 'symbol' attribute value of an
    InitialAssignment cannot be an identifier that is the 'id' attribute
    value of a Reaction object in the model.  This is identical to a
    restriction placed on rules.

    InitialAssignment also has a required 'math' subelement that contains a
    MathML expression used to calculate the value of the constant or the
    initial value of the variable.  The units of the value computed by the
    formula in the 'math' subelement should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to be the
    units associated with the identifier given in the 'symbol' attribute.
    (That is, the units are the units of the species, compartment, or
    parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object identified by the value
    of 'symbol'.)

    InitialAssignment was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
    available in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 nor in any version of Level 1.

    @section initassign-semantics Semantics of Initial Assignments

    The value calculated by an InitialAssignment object overrides the value
    assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
    example, if a compartment's 'size' attribute is set in its definition,
    and the model also contains an InitialAssignment having that
    compartment's identifier as its 'symbol' attribute value, then the
    interpretation is that the 'size' assigned in the Compartment object
    should be ignored and the value assigned based on the computation
    defined in the InitialAssignment.  Initial assignments can take place
    for Compartment, Species and global Parameter objects regardless of the
    value of their 'constant' attribute.

    The actions of all InitialAssignment objects are in general terms
    the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type
    of variable being set:
    <ul>
    <li> <em>In the case of a species</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
    referenced species' initial quantity (concentration or amount of
    substance) to the value determined by the formula in the 'math'
    subelement.    The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
    as the units specified for the species.

    <li> <em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an InitialAssignment sets
    the referenced compartment's initial size to the size determined by the
    formula in 'math'.  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
    as the units specified for the size of the compartment.

    <li> <em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
    referenced parameter's initial value to that determined by the formula
    in 'math'.  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
    as the units defined for the parameter.  </ul>

    In the context of a simulation, initial assignments establish values
    that are in effect prior to and including the start of simulation time,
    i.e., <em>t <= 0</em>.  Section 3.4.8 in the SBML Level 2
    Version 4  and SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specifications provides information about the interpretation of
    assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time up to and
    including the start time <em>t = 0</em>; this is important for
    establishing the initial conditions of a simulation if the model
    involves expressions containing the <em>delay</em> 'csymbol'.

    There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a model;
    that is, a model must not contain two or more InitialAssignment objects
    that both have the same identifier as their 'symbol' attribute value.  A
    model must also not define initial assignments <em>and</em> assignment
    rules for the same entity.  That is, there cannot be <em>both</em> an
    InitialAssignment and an AssignmentRule for the same symbol in a model,
    because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start of
    simulated time&mdash;allowing both to exist for a given symbol would
    result in indeterminism).

    The ordering of InitialAssignment objects is not significant.  The
    combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects form a set of assignment statements that must be considered as a
    whole.  The combined set of assignment statements should not contain
    algebraic loops: a chain of dependency between these statements should
    terminate.  (More formally, consider the directed graph of assignment
    statements where nodes are a model's assignment statements and directed
    arcs exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment statement
    'math' attribute.  The directed arcs in this graph start from the
    statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that contains
    the symbol in their math elements.  Such a graph must be acyclic.)

    Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in the
    following situation.  Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value <em>x</em>
    assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial assignment
    having the identifier as its 'symbol' value and reassigning the value to
    <em>y</em>, <em>and</em> (3) the identifier is also used in the
    mathematical formula of a second initial assignment.  What value should
    the second initial assignment use?  It is <em>y</em>, the value assigned
    to the symbol by the first initial assignment, not whatever value was
    given in the symbol's definition.  This follows directly from the
    behavior described above: if an InitialAssignment object exists for a
    given symbol, then the symbol's value is overridden by that initial
    assignment.

        Calculates and returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units

        The units are calculated based on the mathematical expression in the

        Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the

    variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors
    of those variables.  They enable encoding relationships that cannot be
    expressed using Reaction nor InitialAssignment objects alone.

    The libSBML implementation of rules mirrors the SBML Level&nbsp;3
    Version&nbsp;1 Core definition (which is in turn is very similar to the
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 definition), with Rule being the parent
    class of three subclasses as explained below.  The Rule class itself
    cannot be instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the
    subclasses AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and RateRule can be
    instantiated directly.

    @section general General summary of SBML rules

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into
    three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible
    functional forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some
    arbitrary function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a
    vector of variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and
    <b><em>W</em></b> is a vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):

    <center>
    <table border='0' cellpadding='0' style='font-size: small'>
    <tr><td width='120px'><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width='250px'>left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(<b>V</b>)</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
    </table>
    </center>

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
    separate cases for the following reasons:

    <ul>
    <li> <em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>

    <li> SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>

    <li> Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
    unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
    as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
    could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
    general algebraic equations;<p>

    <li> Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>

    <li> Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
    to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
    </ul>

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
    mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
    numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
    the variables and other entities in an SBML model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from SBase.
    The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
    'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
    RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.

    @section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
    how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
    restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
    of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.

    @subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
    considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
    because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the 'id' attribute of
    the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
    assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
    chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
    consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
    directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
    parameter symbol in an assignment statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the
    directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
    statements that contain the symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions.
    This graph must be acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
    <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
    were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
    because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
    of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
    for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
    Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
    assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
    + 100</em>.

    @subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
    that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in
    Appendix&nbsp;B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core
    specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
    can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
    One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
    represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
    equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
    are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
    there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
    equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
    rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
    single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
    all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
    necessary to find one maximal matching.)

    @section RuleType_t Rule types for SBML Level 1

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
    Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an
    attribute whose value is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML
    supports this using methods that work @if clike a libSBML enumeration
    type, #RuleType_t, whose values are @else with the enumeration
    values @endif listed in the following table.

    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %AlgebraicRule construct.

    The rule type AlgebraicRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
    is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model
    variables nor rates of change.  AlgebraicRule does not add any
    attributes to the basic Rule; its role is simply to distinguish this
    case from the other cases.

    In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all
    times, <em>t</em> >= <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
    expressions that involve the delay 'csymbol' (see the SBML
    specification), algebraic rules are considered to apply also at
    <em>t</em> <= <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
    specification for additional information about the semantics of
    assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
    <= <em>0</em>.

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  The ability to define
    arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model introduces the
    possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the overall
    system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions and events.
    Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a model, for at least
    one of the entities referenced in the rule's 'math' element the value of
    that entity must not be completely determined by other constructs in the
    model.  This means that at least this entity must not have the attribute
    'constant'=@c true and there must also not be a rate rule or assignment
    rule for it.  Furthermore, if the entity is a Species object, its value
    must not be determined by reactions, which means that it must either
    have the attribute 'boundaryCondition'=@c true or else not be involved
    in any reaction at all.  These restrictions are explained in more detail
    in the SBML specification documents.

    In SBML Levels 2 and&nbsp;3, Reaction object identifiers can be
    referenced in the 'math' expression of an algebraic rule, but reaction
    rates can never be <em>determined</em> by algebraic rules.  This is true
    even when a reaction does not contain a KineticLaw element.  (In such
    cases of missing KineticLaw elements, the model is valid but incomplete;
    the rates of reactions lacking kinetic laws are simply undefined, and
    not determined by the algebraic rule.)


    @section general General summary of SBML rules

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into
    three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible
    functional forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some
    arbitrary function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a
    vector of variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and
    <b><em>W</em></b> is a vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):

    <center>
    <table border='0' cellpadding='0' style='font-size: small'>
    <tr><td width='120px'><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width='250px'>left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(<b>V</b>)</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
    </table>
    </center>

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
    separate cases for the following reasons:

    <ul>
    <li> <em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>

    <li> SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>

    <li> Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
    unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
    as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
    could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
    general algebraic equations;<p>

    <li> Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>

    <li> Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
    to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
    </ul>

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
    mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
    numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
    the variables and other entities in an SBML model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from SBase.
    The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
    'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
    RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.

    @section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
    how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
    restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
    of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.

    @subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
    considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
    because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the 'id' attribute of
    the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
    assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
    chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
    consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
    directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
    parameter symbol in an assignment statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the
    directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
    statements that contain the symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions.
    This graph must be acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
    <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
    were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
    because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
    of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
    for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
    Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
    assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
    + 100</em>.

    @subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
    that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
    B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification for assessing
    whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
    can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
    One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
    represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
    equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
    are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
    there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
    equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
    rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
    single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
    all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
    necessary to find one maximal matching.)


    @section RuleType_t Rule types for SBML Level 1

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
    Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an
    attribute whose value is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML
    supports this using methods that work @if clike a libSBML enumeration
    type, #RuleType_t, whose values are @else with the enumeration
    values @endif listed in the following table.

        object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML
        document is a consistent structure.  Nevertheless, the ability to
        supply the values at the time of creation of a AlgebraicRule is an
        important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge of the intented SBML
        Level and Version determine whether it is valid to assign a particular
        value to an attribute, or whether it is valid to add an object to an
        existing SBMLDocument.

    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %AssignmentRule construct.

    The rule type AssignmentRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
    is used to express equations that set the values of variables.  The
    left-hand side (the attribute named 'variable') of an assignment rule
    can refer to the identifier of a Species, SpeciesReference (in SBML
    Level&nbsp;3), Compartment, or Parameter object in the model (but not a
    Reaction).  The entity identified must have its 'constant' attribute set
    to @c false.  The effects of an AssignmentRule are in general terms the
    same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of
    variable being set: <ul>
    <li> <em>In the case of a species</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
    referenced species' quantity (whether a 'concentration' or 'amount') to
    the value determined by the formula in the MathML subelement 'math'.
    The unit associated with the value produced by the 'math' formula @em
    should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in
    SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be equal to the unit
    associated with the species' quantity.  <em>Restrictions</em>: There
    must not be both an AssignmentRule 'variable' attribute and a
    SpeciesReference 'species' attribute having the same value, unless the
    referenced Species object has its 'boundaryCondition' attribute set to
    @c true.  In other words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a
    species that is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species
    is defined as a boundary condition in the model.

    <li> (For SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) <em>In the case of a species
    reference</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the stoichiometry of the
    referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in
    'math'.  The unit associated with the value produced by the 'math'
    formula should be consistent with the unit 'dimensionless', because
    reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
    quantities.

    <li> <em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
    referenced compartment's size to the value determined by the formula in
    the 'math' subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units
    of the formula in 'math' @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
    and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
    version&nbsp;4) be the same as the units of the size of the compartment.

    <li> <em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
    referenced parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the
    'math' subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units of
    the formula in the 'math' subelement @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in SBML releases prior to
    Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be the same as the units defined for the
    parameter.  </ul>

    In the context of a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at all
    times, <em>t</em> >= <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
    expressions that involve the <em>delay</em> 'csymbol' (see the SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 specification), assignment rules are considered to apply
    also at <em>t</em> <= <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant
    SBML specification for additional information about the semantics of
    assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
    <= <em>0</em>.

    A model must not contain more than one AssignmentRule or RateRule
    object having the same value of 'variable'; in other words, in the set
    of all assignment rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable
    appearing in the left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply
    follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a
    model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or
    both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.

    Similarly, a model must also not contain <em>both</em> an AssignmentRule
    and an InitialAssignment for the same variable, because both kinds of
    constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulation time, i.e.,
    <em>t</em> <= <em>0</em>.  If a model contained both an initial
    assignment and an assignment rule for the same variable, an
    indeterminate system would result.

    The value calculated by an AssignmentRule object overrides the value
    assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
    example, if a Compartment object's 'size' attribute value is set in its
    definition, and the model also contains an AssignmentRule object having
    that compartment's 'id' as its 'variable' value, then the 'size'
    assigned in the Compartment object definition is ignored and the value
    assigned based on the computation defined in the AssignmentRule.  This
    does <em>not</em> mean that a definition for a given symbol can be
    omitted if there is an AssignmentRule object for it.  For example, there
    must be a Parameter definition for a given parameter if there is an
    AssignmentRule for that parameter.  It is only a question of which value
    definition takes precedence.

    @section general General summary of SBML rules

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into three
    subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional
    forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some arbitrary
    function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a vector of
    variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and <b><em>W</em></b> is a
    vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):

    <center>
    <table border='0' cellpadding='0' style='font-size: small'>
    <tr><td width='120px'><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width='250px'>left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(<b>V</b>)</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
    </table>
    </center>

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
    separate cases for the following reasons:

    <ul>
    <li> <em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>

    <li> SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>

    <li> Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
    unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
    as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
    could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
    general algebraic equations;<p>

    <li> Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>

    <li> Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
    to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
    </ul>

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
    mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
    numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
    the variables and other entities in an SBML model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from SBase.
    The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
    'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
    RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.

    @section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
    how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
    restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
    of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.

    @subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
    considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
    because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the 'id' attribute of
    the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
    assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
    chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
    consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
    directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
    parameter symbol in an assignment statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the
    directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
    statements that contain the symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions.
    This graph must be acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
    <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
    were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
    because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
    of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
    for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
    Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
    assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
    + 100</em>.

    @subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
    that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in
    Appendix&nbsp;B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core
    specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
    can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
    One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
    represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
    equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
    are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
    there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
    equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
    rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
    single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
    all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
    necessary to find one maximal matching.)


    @section RuleType_t Rule types for SBML Level 1

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
    Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an
    attribute whose value is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML
    supports this using methods that work @if clike a libSBML enumeration
    type, #RuleType_t, whose values are @else with the enumeration
    values @endif listed in the following table.

    <li> SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>

    <li> Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
    unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
    as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
    could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
    general algebraic equations;<p>

    <li> Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>

    <li> Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
    to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
    </ul>

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
    mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
    numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
    the variables and other entities in an SBML model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from SBase.
    The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
    'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
    RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.

    @section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
    how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
    restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
    of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.

    @subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
    considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
    because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the 'id' attribute of
    the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
    assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
    chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
    consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
    directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
    parameter symbol in an assignment statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the
    directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
    statements that contain the symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions.
    This graph must be acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
    <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
    were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
    because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
    of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
    for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
    Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
    assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
    + 100</em>.

    @subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
    that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in
    Appendix&nbsp;B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core
    specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
    can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
    One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
    represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
    equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
    are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
    there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
    equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
    rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
    single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
    all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
    necessary to find one maximal matching.)


    @section RuleType_t Rule types for SBML Level 1

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
    Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an
    attribute whose value is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML
    supports this using methods that work @if clike a libSBML enumeration
    type, #RuleType_t, whose values are @else with the enumeration
    values @endif listed in the following table.

    Constraint has one required subelement, 'math', containing a MathML
    formula defining the condition of the constraint.  This formula must
    return a boolean value of @c true when the model is a <em>valid</em>
    state.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the
    variables and other entities in an SBML model.  The evaluation of 'math'
    and behavior of constraints are described in more detail below.

    A Constraint structure also has an optional subelement called 'message'.
    This can contain a message in XHTML format that may be displayed to the
    user when the condition of the formula in the 'math' subelement
    evaluates to a value of @c false.  Software tools are not required to
    display the message, but it is recommended that they do so as a matter
    of best practice.  The XHTML content within a 'message' subelement must
    follow the same restrictions as for the 'notes' element on SBase
    described in in the SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification; please consult the
    <a target='_blank' href='http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications'>SBML
    specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
    of your model for more information about the requirements for 'notes'
    content.

    Constraint was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2.  It is
    not available in earlier versions of Level&nbsp;2 nor in any version of
    Level&nbsp;1.

    @section constraint-semantics Semantics of Constraints

    In the context of a simulation, a Constraint has effect at all times
    <em>t >= 0</em>.  Each Constraint's 'math' subelement is first
    evaluated after any InitialAssignment definitions in a model at <em>t =
    0</em> and can conceivably trigger at that point.  (In other words, a
    simulation could fail a constraint immediately.)

    Constraint structures <em>cannot and should not</em> be used to compute
    the dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example, simulation.
    Constraints may be used as input to non-dynamical analysis, for instance
    by expressing flux constraints for flux balance analysis.

    The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are
    invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the function
    given by the 'math' subelement returns a value of @c false.  Invalid
    simulation results do not make a prediction of the behavior of the
    biochemical reaction network represented by the model.  The precise
    behavior of simulation tools is left undefined with respect to
    constraints.  If invalid results are detected with respect to a given
    constraint, the 'message' subelement may optionally be displayed to the
    user.  The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or clearly
    delimit in output data the simulation time point at which the simulation
    results become invalid.

    SBML does not impose restrictions on duplicate Constraint definitions or
    the order of evaluation of Constraint objects in a model.  It is
    possible for a model to define multiple constraints all with the same
    mathematical expression.  Since the failure of any constraint indicates
    that the model simulation has entered an invalid state, a system is not
    required to attempt to detect whether other constraints in the model
    have failed once any one constraint has failed.

    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfConstraints construct.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Reaction(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Reaction construct.

    A @em reaction represents any transformation, transport or binding
    process, typically a chemical reaction, that can change the quantity of
    one or more species.  In SBML, a reaction is defined primarily in terms
    of the participating reactants and products (and their corresponding
    stoichiometries), along with optional modifier species, an optional rate
    at which the reaction takes place, and optional parameters.  

    As with other major object in SBML, Reaction has a mandatory attribute,
    'id', used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The identifier
    must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in
    SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3, the reaction 'id'
    identifier can be used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an SBML
    model to represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained
    below.  Reaction also has an optional 'name' attribute, of type @c
    string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the guidelines
    described in the SBML specification.

    The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers in a
    reaction are declared using lists of SpeciesReference and/or
    ModifierSpeciesReference instances stored in subelements
    'listOfReactants', 'listOfProducts' and 'listOfModifiers'.  Certain
    restrictions are placed on the appearance of species in reaction
    definitions:
    <ul>
    <li> The ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product of any
    reaction in a model is governed by certain flags in that species'
    definition; see the definition of Species for more information.

    <li> Any species appearing in the mathematical formula of the subelement
    'kineticLaw' (described below) of a Reaction must be declared in at
    least one of that Reaction's lists of reactants, products, and/or
    modifiers.  Put another way, it is an error for a reaction's kinetic law
    formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that
    reaction.

    <li> A reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants
    <em>or</em> an empty list of products, but it must have at least one
    reactant or product; in other words, a reaction without any reactant or
    product species is not permitted.  (This restriction does not apply to
    modifier species, which remain optional in all cases.)
    </ul>

    A reaction can contain up to one KineticLaw object in a subelement named
    'kineticLaw'.  It defines the speed at which the process defined by the
    reaction takes place.  The description of KineticLaw provides more
    details about its use.  Note that although the inclusion of a KineticLaw
    object in an instance of a Reaction component is optional, there is no
    useful default that can be substituted in place of a missing rate
    expression in a reaction.  Moreover, a reaction's rate cannot be defined
    in any other way in SBML&mdash;InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule,
    RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and other constructs in SBML cannot be
    used to set the reaction rate separately.  Nevertheless, for some
    modeling applications, reactions without any defined rate can be
    perfectly acceptable.

    Reaction also has a boolean attribute named 'reversible' for indicating
    whether the reaction is reversible.  This attribute is optional in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2, with a default of @c true; it is mandatory in SBML
    Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  To say that a reaction is @em
    reversible is to say it can proceed in either the forward or the reverse
    direction.  Although the reversibility of a reaction can sometimes be
    deduced by inspecting its rate expression, this is not always the case,
    especially for complicated expressions.  Moreover, the need in SBML to
    allow rate expressions (i.e., KineticLaw) to be optional leads to the
    need for a separate flag indicating reversibility.  Note that labeling a
    reaction as irreversible is an assertion that the reaction always
    proceeds in the given forward direction.  (Why else would it be flagged
    as irreversible?)  This implies the rate expression in the KineticLaw
    always has a non-negative value during simulations.  Software tools
    could provide a means of optionally testing that this condition holds.
    The presence of reversibility information in two places (i.e., the rate
    expression and the 'reversible' attribute on Reaction) leaves open the
    possibility that a model could contain contradictory information, but
    the creation of such a model would be an error on the part of the
    software generating it.

    The Reaction object class has another boolean attribute called 'fast'.
    This attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, with a default of @c
    false; it is mandatory in SBML Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  It
    is used to indicate that a reaction occurs on a vastly faster time scale
    than others in a system.  Readers are directed to the SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;4 specification, which provides more detail about the
    conditions under which a reaction can be considered to be fast in this
    sense.  The attribute's default value is @c false.  SBML Level&nbsp;1
    and Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 incorrectly claimed that software tools
    could ignore this attribute if they did not implement support for the
    corresponding concept; however, further research in SBML has revealed
    that this is not true, and 'fast' <em>cannot be ignored</em> if it is
    set to @c true.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 therefore
    stipulate that if a model has any reactions with 'fast' set to @c true,
    a software tool must be able to respect the attribute or else indicate
    to the user that it does not have the capacity to do so.  Analysis
    software cannot ignore the value of the 'fast' attribute because doing
    so may lead to different results as compared to a software system that
    <em>does</em> make use of 'fast'.

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1, the Reaction object has an
    additional optional attribute named 'compartment', whose value must be
    the identifier of a compartment defined in the enclosing Model object.
    The 'compartment' attribute can be used to indicate the compartment in
    which the reaction is assumed to take place.  If the attribute is
    present, its value must be the identifier of a Compartment object
    defined in the enclosing Model object.  Similar to the 'reversible'
    attribute, the value of the 'compartment' attribute has no direct impact
    on the construction of mathematical equations for the SBML model.  When
    a kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment location may
    already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this cannot always be
    guaranteed).  Nevertheless, software tools may find the 'compartment'
    attribute value useful for such purposes as analyzing the structure of
    the model, guiding the modeler in constructing correct rate formulas,
    and visualization purposes.

    Readers are urged to read the SBML specification for more details about
    the proper use of Reaction.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for

    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class KineticLaw(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %KineticLaw construct.

    An object of class KineticLaw is used to describe the rate at which the
    process defined by a given Reaction takes place.  KineticLaw has
    subelements called 'math' (for MathML content) and 'listOfParameters'
    (of class ListOfParameters), in addition to the attributes and
    subelements it inherits from SBase.

    KineticLaw's 'math' subelement for holding a MathML formula defines the
    rate of the reaction.  The formula may refer to other entities in a
    model as well as local parameter definitions within the scope of the
    Reaction (see below).  It is important to keep in mind, however, that
    the only Species identifiers that can be used in this formula are those
    declared in the lists of reactants, products and modifiers in the
    Reaction structure.  (In other words, before a species can be referenced
    in the KineticLaw, it must be declared in one of those lists.)

    KineticLaw provides a way to define @em local parameters whose
    identifiers can be used in the 'math' formula of that KineticLaw
    instance.  Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;3, these parameter definitions are
    stored inside a 'listOfParameters' subelement containing Parameter
    objects; in SBML Level&nbsp;3, this is achieved using a specialized
    object class called LocalParameter and the containing subelement is
    called 'listOfLocalParameters'.  In both cases, the parameters so
    defined are only visible within the KineticLaw; they cannot be accessed
    outside.  A local parameter within one reaction is not visible from
    within another reaction, nor is it visible to any other construct
    outside of the KineticLaw in which it is defined.  In addition, another
    important feature is that if such a Parameter (or in Level&nbsp;3,
    LocalParameter) object has the same identifier as another object in the
    scope of the enclosing Model, the definition inside the KineticLaw takes
    precedence.  In other words, within the KineticLaw's 'math' formula,
    references to local parameter identifiers <strong>shadow any identical
    global identifiers</strong>.

    The values of local parameters defined within KineticLaw objects cannot
    change.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, this quality is built into the
    LocalParameter construct.  In Level&nbsp;2, where the same kind of
    Parameter object class is used as for global parameters, the Parameter
    objects' 'constant' attribute must always have a value of @c true
    (either explicitly or left to its default value).


    @section shadowing-warning A warning about identifier shadowing

    A common misconception is that different classes of objects (e.g.,
    species, compartments, parameters) in SBML have different identifier
    scopes.  They do not.  The implication is that if a KineticLaw's local
    parameter definition uses an identifier identical to @em any other
    identifier defined in the model outside the KineticLaw, even if the
    other identifier does @em not belong to a parameter type of object, the
    local parameter's identifier takes precedence within that KineticLaw's
    'math' formula.  It is not an error in SBML for identifiers to shadow
    each other this way, but can lead to confusing and subtle errors.


    @section version-diffs SBML Level/Version differences

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1, the SBML specification
    included two additional attributes on KineticLaw called 'substanceUnits'
    and 'timeUnits'.  They were removed beginning with SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;2 because further research determined they introduced many
    problems.  The most significant problem was that their use could easily
    lead to the creation of valid models whose reactions nevertheless could
    not be integrated into a system of equations without outside knowledge
    for converting the quantities used.  Examination of real-life models
    revealed that a common reason for using 'substanceUnits' on KineticLaw
    was to set the units of all reactions to the same set of substance
    units, something that is better achieved by using UnitDefinition to
    redefine @c 'substance' for the whole Model.

    As mentioned above, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, local
    parameters are of class Parameter.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the class of
    object is LocalParameter.

        This method has multiple variants that differ in the arguments they accept.  Each is described separately below.

        <hr>
        Method variant with the following signature:
        <pre class='signature'>KineticLaw(long level, long version)</pre>

        Creates a new KineticLaw using the given SBML @p level and @p version
        values.

        @param level a long integer, the SBML Level to assign to this KineticLaw

        @param version a long integer, the SBML Version to assign to this
        KineticLaw

        @note Upon the addition of a KineticLaw object to an SBMLDocument
        (e.g., using Reaction.setKineticLaw()), the SBML Level, SBML Version
        and XML namespace of the document @em override the values used
        when creating the KineticLaw object via this constructor.  This is
        necessary to ensure that an SBML document is a consistent structure.
        Nevertheless, the ability to supply the values at the time of creation
        of a KineticLaw is an important aid to producing valid SBML.  Knowledge
        of the intented SBML Level and Version determine whether it is valid
        to assign a particular value to an attribute, or whether it is valid
        to add an object to an existing SBMLDocument.
          

        <hr>
        Method variant with the following signature:
        <pre class='signature'>KineticLaw(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)</pre>

        Creates a new KineticLaw using the given SBMLNamespaces object
        @p sbmlns.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core.
        A common approach to using this class constructor is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program, once, then pass it to
        object constructors such as this one when needed.

        @param sbmlns an SBMLNamespaces object.

        @note Upon the addition of a KineticLaw object to an SBMLDocument
        (e.g., using Reaction.setKineticLaw()), the SBML XML namespace of the
        document @em overrides the value used when creating the KineticLaw
        object via this constructor.  This is necessary to ensure that an SBML

    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %SimpleSpeciesReference construct.

    As mentioned in the description of Reaction, every species that enters
    into a given reaction must appear in that reaction's lists of reactants,
    products and/or modifiers.  In an SBML model, all species that may
    participate in any reaction are listed in the 'listOfSpecies' element of
    the top-level Model object.  Lists of products, reactants and modifiers
    in Reaction objects do not introduce new species, but rather, they refer
    back to those listed in the model's top-level 'listOfSpecies'.  For
    reactants and products, the connection is made using SpeciesReference
    objects; for modifiers, it is made using ModifierSpeciesReference
    objects.  SimpleSpeciesReference is an abstract type that serves as the
    parent class of both SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference.  It
    is used simply to hold the attributes and elements that are common to
    the latter two structures.

    The SimpleSpeciesReference structure has a mandatory attribute,
    'species', which must be a text string conforming to the identifer
    syntax permitted in %SBML.  This attribute is inherited by the
    SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference subclasses derived from
    SimpleSpeciesReference.  The value of the 'species' attribute must be
    the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing Model.  The species
    is thereby declared as participating in the reaction being defined.  The
    precise role of that species as a reactant, product, or modifier in the
    reaction is determined by the subclass of SimpleSpeciesReference (i.e.,
    either SpeciesReference or ModifierSpeciesReference) in which the
    identifier appears.

    SimpleSpeciesReference also contains an optional attribute, 'id',
    allowing instances to be referenced from other structures.  No SBML
    structures currently do this; however, such structures are anticipated
    in future SBML Levels.

    A species can occur more than once in the lists of reactants and

    of reactants.  A positive value indicates the species is effectively a
    product and a negative value indicates the species is effectively a
    reactant.  SBML places no restrictions on the effective stoichiometry of
    a species in a reaction; for example, it can be zero.  In the following
    SBML fragment, the two reactions have the same effective stoichiometry
    for all their species:
    @code

        </listProducts>
    </reaction>
    @endcode

    The precise structure of SpeciesReference differs between SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3.  We discuss the two variants in separate
    sections below.

    @section spr-l2 SpeciesReference in SBML Level 2

    The mandatory 'species' attribute of SpeciesReference must have as its
    value the identifier of an existing species defined in the enclosing
    Model.  The species is thereby designated as a reactant or product in
    the reaction.  Which one it is (i.e., reactant or product) is indicated
    by whether the SpeciesReference appears in the Reaction's 'reactant' or
    'product' lists.

    Product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using
    <em>either</em> 'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' in a
    SpeciesReference object.  The 'stoichiometry' attribute is of type
    double and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
    'stoichiometryMath' element is implemented as an element containing a
    MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
    'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' should be defined in a given
    SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
    is present, the value of 'stoichiometry' in the SpeciesReference
    instance defaults to @c 1.

    For maximum interoperability, the 'stoichiometry' attribute should be
    used in preference to 'stoichiometryMath' when a species' stoichiometry
    is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).  When the stoichiometry
    is a rational number, or when it is a more complicated formula,
    'stoichiometryMath' must be used.  The MathML expression in
    'stoichiometryMath' may also refer to identifiers of entities in a model
    (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only species identifiers
    that can be used in 'stoichiometryMath' are those referenced in the
    Reaction list of reactants, products and modifiers.

    The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
    X0, with stoichiometry @c 2, in a list of reactants within a reaction
    having the identifier @c J1:
    @code
    <model>
        ...
        <listOfReactions>
            <reaction id='J1'>
                <listOfReactants>
                    <speciesReference species='X0' stoichiometry='2'>
                </listOfReactants>
                ...
            </reaction>
            ...
        </listOfReactions>
        ...
    </model>
    @endcode

    The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
    species X0, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of the parameter
    @c x:
    @code
    <model>
        ...

    @section spr-l3 SpeciesReference in SBML Level 3

    In Level 2's definition of a reaction, the stoichiometry attribute of a
    SpeciesReference is actually a combination of two factors, the standard
    biochemical stoichiometry and a conversion factor that may be needed to
    translate the units of the species quantity to the units of the reaction
    rate. Unfortunately, Level&nbsp;2 offers no direct way of decoupling
    these two factors, or for explicitly indicating the units. The only way
    to do it in Level&nbsp;2 is to use the StoichiometryMath object
    associated with SpeciesReferences, and to reference SBML Parameter
    objects from within the StoichiometryMath formula. This works because
    Parameter offers a way to attach units to a numerical value, but the
    solution is indirect and awkward for something that should be a simple
    matter.  Moreover, the question of how to properly encode
    stoichiometries in SBML reactions has caused much confusion among
    implementors of SBML software.

    SBML Level&nbsp;3 approaches this problem differently.  It (1) extends
    the the use of the SpeciesReference identifier to represent the value of
    the 'stoichiometry' attribute, (2) makes the 'stoichiometry' attribute
    optional, (3) removes StoichiometryMath, and (4) adds a new 'constant'
    boolean attribute on SpeciesReference.

    As in Level&nbsp;2, the 'stoichiometry' attribute is of type
    @c double and should contain values greater than zero (@c 0).  A
    missing 'stoichiometry' implies that the stoichiometry is either
    unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an
    InitialAssignment object or other SBML construct elsewhere in the model.

    A species reference's stoichiometry is set by its 'stoichiometry'
    attribute exactly once.  If the SpeciesReference object's 'constant'
    attribute has the value @c true, then the stoichiometry is fixed and
    cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment object.  These two
    methods of setting the stoichiometry (i.e., using 'stoichiometry'
    directly, or using InitialAssignment) differ in that the 'stoichiometry'
    attribute can only be set to a literal floating-point number, whereas
    InitialAssignment allows the value to be set using an arbitrary
    mathematical expression.  (As an example, the approach could be used to
    set the stoichiometry to a rational number of the form @em p/@em q,
    where @em p and @em q are integers, something that is occasionally
    useful in the context of biochemical reaction networks.)  If the species
    reference's 'constant' attribute has the value @c false, the species
    reference's value may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed
    by AssignmentRule or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for simulation time
    <em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be changed by a RateRule or Event
    objects.  (However, some of these constructs are mutually exclusive; see
    the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specifiation for more
    details.)  It is not an error to define 'stoichiometry' on a species
    reference and also redefine the stoichiometry using an
    InitialAssignment, but the 'stoichiometry' attribute in that case is
    ignored.

    The value of the 'id' attribute of a SpeciesReference can be used as the
    content of a <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> element in MathML formulas
    elsewhere in the model.  When the identifier appears in a MathML
    <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> element, it represents the stoichiometry of the
    corresponding species in the reaction where the SpeciesReference object
    instance appears.  More specifically, it represents the value of the
    'stoichiometry' attribute on the SpeciesReference object.

    In SBML Level 3, the unit of measurement associated with the value of a
    species' stoichiometry is always considered to be @c dimensionless.
    This has the following implications:
    <ul>

    <li> When a species reference's identifier appears in mathematical
    formulas elsewhere in the model, the unit associated with that value is
    @c dimensionless.

    <li> The units of the 'math' elements of AssignmentRule,
    InitialAssignment and EventAssignment objects setting the stoichiometry
    of the species reference should be @c dimensionless.

    <li> If a species reference's identifier is the subject of a RateRule,
    the unit associated with the RateRule object's value should be
    <code>dimensionless</code>/<em>time</em>, where <em>time</em> is the
    model-wide unit of time set on the Model object.

    </ul>

    @subsection sbml-l3 SBML Level 3

    SBML Level 3 introduces several changes to the structure and components
    of Events compared to SBML Level&nbsp;2.  These changes fall into two
    main categories: changes to what is optional or required, and additions
    of new attributes and elements.
    <ul>
    <li> The attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on Event is mandatory (it
    was optional in Level&nbsp;2);
    <li> Event's 'listOfEventAssignments' element (of class
    ListOfEventAssignments) is optional (it was mandatory in Level&nbsp;2);
    <li> Event's 'priority' element (of class Priority) is new in
    Level&nbsp;3; and
    <li> The Trigger object gains new mandatory attributes (described as part
    of the definition of Trigger).
    </ul>

    The changes to the attributes of Event are described below; the changes
    to Trigger and Priority are described in their respective sections.

    @subsection sbml-l2 SBML Level 2

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the semantics of
    Event time delays were defined such that the expressions in the event's
    assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was
    <em>triggered</em>.  This definition made it difficult to define an event
    whose assignment formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the
    event was <em>executed</em> (i.e., after the time period defined by the
    value of the Delay element).  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in
    Level&nbsp;3, the attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on Event allows a
    model to indicate the time at which the event's assignments are intended
    the values of the assignment formulas are computed at the moment the
    event is triggered, not after the delay.  If 'useValuesFromTriggerTime'=@c
    false, it means that the formulas in the event's assignments are to be
    computed @em after the delay, at the time the event is executed.

    The definition of Event in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 1 and 2 includes
    an additional attribute called 'timeUnits', which allowed the time units
    of the Delay to be set explicitly.  Later Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2
    as well as SBML Level&nbsp;3 do not define this attribute.  LibSBML
    supports this attribute for compatibility with previous versions of SBML
    Level&nbsp;2; however, if a model in SBML Level&nbsp;3 or Level&nbsp;2
    Versions&nbsp;3&ndash;4 format sets the attribute, the
    consistency-checking method SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() will report
    an error.

    The attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' was introduced in SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4.  Models defined in prior Versions of SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 cannot use this attribute, and
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() will report an error if they do.

    @section semantics Semantics of events in SBML Level 3 Version&nbsp;1

    The detailed semantics of events are described in the specification
    documents for each SBML Level/Version.  Here we include the description
    from the SBML Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1.
    Any transition of a Trigger object's 'math' formula from the value @c
    false to @c true will cause the enclosing Event object to
    <em>trigger</em>.  Such a transition is not possible at the very start
    of a simulation (i.e., at time <em>t = 0</em>) unless the Trigger
    object's 'initialValue' attribute has a value of @c false; this defines
    the value of the trigger formula to be @c false immediately prior to the
    start of simulation, thereby giving it the potential to change in value
    from @c false to @c true when the formula is evaluated at <em>t =
    0</em>.  If 'initialValue'=@c true, then the trigger expression cannot
    transition from @c false to @c true at <em>t = 0</em> but may do so at
    some time <em>t > 0</em>.

    Consider an Event object definition <EM>E</EM> with delay <em>d</em> in
    which the Trigger object's 'math' formula makes a transition in value
    from @c false to @c true at times <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> and
    <em>t<sub>2</sub></em>.  The EventAssignment within the Event object
    will have effect at <em>t<sub>1</sub> + d</em> and
    <em>t<sub>2</sub> + d</em> irrespective of the relative times of
    <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>t<sub>2</sub></em>.  For example, events
    can 'overlap' so that <em>t<sub>1</sub> < t<sub>2</sub> <
    t<sub>1</sub> + d</em> still causes an event assignments to occur at
    <em>t<sub>1</sub> + d</em> and <em>t<sub>2</sub> + d</em>.

    It is entirely possible for two events to be executed simultaneously,
    and it is possible for events to trigger other events (i.e., an event
    assignment can cause an event to trigger).  This leads to several
    points:
    <ul>

    <li> A software package should retest all event triggers after executing
    an event assignment in order to account for the possibility that the
    assignment causes another event trigger to transition from @c false to
    @c true.  This check should be made after each individual Event object's
    execution, even when several events are to be executed simultaneously.

    <li> Any Event object whose Trigger 'persistent' attribute has the value
    @c false must have its trigger expression reevaluated continuously
    between when the event is triggered and when it is executed.  If
    its trigger expression ever evaluates to @c false, it must be removed
    from the queue of events pending execution and treated as any other
    event whose trigger expression evaluates to @c false.

    <li> Although the precise time at which events are executed is not
    resolved beyond the given execution point in simulated time, it is
    assumed that the order in which the events occur <em>is</em> resolved.
    This order can be significant in determining the overall outcome of a
    given simulation.  When an event <EM>X</EM> <em>triggers</em> another
    event <EM>Y</EM> and event <EM>Y</EM> has zero delay, then event
    <EM>Y</EM> is added to the existing set of simultaneous events that are
    pending <em>execution</em>.  Events <EM>X</EM> and <EM>Y</EM> form a
    cascade of events at the same point in simulation time.  An event such
    as <EM>Y</EM> may have a special priority if it contains a Priority
    subobject.

    <li> All events in a model are open to being in a cascade.  The position
    of an event in the event queue does not affect whether it can be in the
    cascade: event <EM>Y</EM> can be triggered whether it is before or after
    <EM>X</EM> in the queue of events pending execution.  A cascade of
    events can be potentially infinite (never terminate); when this occurs a
    simulator should indicate this has occurred&mdash;it is incorrect for a
    simulator to break a cascade arbitrarily and continue the simulation
    without at least indicating that the infinite cascade occurred.

    <li> Simultaneous events having no defined priorities are executed in an
    undefined order.  This does not mean that the behavior of the simulation
    is completely undefined; merely that the <em>order</em> of execution of
    these particular events is undefined.  A given simulator may use any
    algorithm to choose an order as long as every event is executed exactly
    once.

    <li> Events with defined priorities are executed in the order implied by
    their Priority 'math' formula values, with events having higher
    priorities being executed ahead of events with lower priorities, and
    events with identical priorities being executed in a random order with
    respect to one another (as determined at run-time by some random
    algorithm equivalent to coin-flipping).  Newly-triggered events that are
    to be executed immediately (i.e., if they define no delays) should be
    inserted into the queue of events pending execution according to their
    priorities: events with higher priority values value must be inserted
    ahead of events with lower priority values and after any pending events
    with even higher priorities, and inserted randomly among pending events
    with the same priority values.  Events without Priority objects must be
    inserted into the queue in some fashion, but the algorithm used to place
    it in the queue is undefined.  Similarly, there is no restriction on the
    order of a newly-inserted event with a defined Priority with respect to
    any other pending Event without a defined Priority.

    <li> A model variable that is the target of one or more event
    assignments can change more than once when simultaneous events are
    processed at some time point <em>t</em>.  The model's behavior (output)
    for such a variable is the value of the variable at the end of
    processing all the simultaneous events at time <em>t</em>.

        The optional Delay on Event means there are two times to consider when

        <em>executed</em>.  It is also possible to distinguish between the

        the event is <em>executed</em>, but it could also be defined to be
        evaluated at the time the event is <em>triggered</em>.

        In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions prior to Version&nbsp;4, the semantics
        of Event time delays were defined such that the expressions in the
        event's assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was

        allows a model to indicate the time at which the event's assignments
        are intended to be evaluated.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has
        a default value of @c true, which corresponds to the interpretation of
        event assignments prior to Version&nbsp;4: the values of the
        assignment formulas are computed at the moment the event is triggered,
        not after the delay.  If 'useValuesFromTriggerTime'=@c false, it means
        that the formulas in the event's assignments are to be computed after
        the delay, at the time the event is executed.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3,

    LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfEvents construct.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
    the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
    subelements of SBase, such as 'metaid' as and 'annotation'.  The
    ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is

    @image html listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'
    @image latex listof-illustration.jpg 'ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model'

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
    all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
    in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
    components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
    derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
    the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class EventAssignment(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %EventAssignment construct for %Event.

    Event contains an optional element called 'listOfEventAssignments', of
    class ListOfEventAssignments.  In every instance of an event definition
    in a model, the object's 'listOfEventAssignments' element must have a
    non-empty list of one or more 'eventAssignment' elements of class
    EventAssignment.  The object class EventAssignment has one required
    attribute, 'variable', and a required element, 'math'.  Being derived
    from SBase, it also has all the usual attributes and elements of its
    parent class.

    An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
    affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The purpose
    of the EventAssignment object class is to define how variables are
    affected by an Event.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, every Event object instance
    must have a nonempty list of event assignments; in SBML Level&nbsp;3,
    the list of assignments is optional.

    The operation of an Event is divided into two phases (regardless of
    whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is @em triggered,
    and the other when the event is @em executed.   EventAssignment objects
    are interpreted when an event is executed.  The effects are described
    below.

    @section event-variable The attribute 'variable'

    The EventAssignment attribute 'variable' must be the identifier of an
    existing Compartment, Species, SpeciesReference, or Parameter
    instance defined in the model.  When the event is executed, the value of
    the model component identified by 'variable' is changed by the
    EventAssignment to the value computed by the 'math' element; that is, a
    species' quantity, species reference's stoichiometry, compartment's size
    or parameter's value are reset to the value computed by 'math'.

    Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in 'variable':
    <ul>
    <li> The object identified by the value of the EventAssignment attribute
    'variable' must not have its 'constant' attribute set to or default to
    @c true.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)

    <li> The 'variable' attribute must not contain the identifier of a
    reaction; only species, species references, compartment and parameter
    values may be set by an Event.

    <li> The value of every 'variable' attribute must be unique among the set
    of EventAssignment structures within a given Event structure.  In other
    words, a single event cannot have multiple EventAssignment objects
    assigning the same variable.  (All of them would be performed at the
    same time when that particular Event triggers, resulting in
    indeterminacy.)  However, @em separate Event instances can refer to the
    same variable.
     
    <li> A variable cannot be assigned a value in an EventAssignment object
    instance and also be assigned a value by an AssignmentRule; i.e., the
    value of an EventAssignment's 'variable' attribute cannot be the same as
    the value of a AssignmentRule' 'variable' attribute.  (Assignment rules
    hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an
    event that reassigns the value of the same variable.)
    </ul>

    Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the
    value of the 'variable' attribute is always the time at which the Event
    is <em>executed</em>, not when it is <em>triggered</em>.  The timing is
    controlled by the optional Delay in an Event.  The time of
    assignment is not affected by the 'useValuesFromTriggerTime'
    attribute on Eventmdash;that attribute affects the time at which the
    EventAssignment's 'math' expression is @em evaluated.  In other
    words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which the
    'variable' is assigned from the time at which its value
    expression is calculated.

    @section event-math The 'math' subelement in an EventAssignment

    The MathML expression contained in an EventAssignment defines the new
    value of the variable being assigned by the Event.

    As mentioned above, the time at which the expression in 'math' is
    evaluated is determined by the attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on
    Event.  If the attribute value is @c true, the expression must be
    evaluated when the event is @em triggered; more precisely, the values of
    identifiers occurring in MathML <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements in the
    EventAssignment's 'math' expression are the values they have at the
    point when the event @em triggered.  If, instead,
    'useValuesFromTriggerTime''s value is @c false, it means the values at
    @em execution time should be used; that is, the values of identifiers
    occurring in MathML <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements in the
    EventAssignment's 'math' expression are the values they have at the
    point when the event @em executed.

    @section version-diffs SBML Level/Version differences

    Between Version&nbsp;4 and previous versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2, the
    requirements regarding the matching of units between an
    EvengAssignment's formula and the units of the object identified by the
    'variable' attribute changed.  Previous versions required consistency,
    but in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3, unit
    consistency is only @em recommended.  More precisely:
    <ul>

    <li> In the case of a species, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
    species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value
    determined by the formula in the EventAssignment's 'math' subelement.
    The units of the 'math' formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;4 and in Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions of
    Level&nbsp;2) be identical to the units of the species.

    <li> (SBML Level&nbsp;3 only.) In the case of a species reference, an
    EventAssignment sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or product
    referenced by the SpeciesReference object to the value determined by the
    formula in the 'math' element.  The unit associated with the value
    produced by the 'math' formula should be @c dimensionless, because
    reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
    quantities.

    <li> In the case of a compartment, an EventAssignment sets the
    referenced compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in
    the 'math' subelement of the EventAssignment.  The overall units of the
    formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in Level&nbsp;3)
    or must (in previous Versions of Level&nbsp;2) be identical to the units
    specified for the size of the compartment identified by the
    EventAssignment's 'variable' attribute.

    <li> In the case of a parameter, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
    parameter's value to that determined by the formula in 'math'.  The
    overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
    and Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions of Level&nbsp;2) be
    identical to the units defined for the parameter.
    </ul>

    Note that the formula placed in the 'math' element <em>has no assumed
    units</em>.  The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units
    of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly
    established just as in the case of the value of the Delay subelement.
    An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of Delay may be
    used for the formula of an EventAssignment.

    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Trigger construct for %Event.

    An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
    affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The Trigger
    construct in SBML is used to define a mathematical expression that
    determines when an Event is @em triggered.

    A Trigger object in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 contains one
    subelement named 'math' containing a MathML expression.  The expression
    must evaluate to a value of type @c boolean.  The exact moment at which
    the expression evaluates to @c true is the time point when the Event is
    @em triggered.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, Trigger has additional attributes
    that must be assigned values; they are discussed in a separate section
    below.

    An event only @em triggers when its Trigger expression makes the
    transition in value from @c false to @c true.  The event will also
    trigger at any subsequent time points when the trigger makes this
    transition; in other words, an event can be triggered multiple times
    during a simulation if its trigger condition makes the transition from
    @c false to @c true more than once.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the behavior
    at the very start of simulation (i.e., at <em>t = 0</em>, where
    <em>t</em> stands for time) is determined in part by the boolean flag
    'initialValue'.  This and other additional features introduced in SBML
    Level&nbsp;3 are discussed further below.

    @section version-diffs Version differences

    SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 introduces two required attributes
    on the Trigger object: 'persistent' and 'initialValue'.  The rest of
    this introduction describes these two attributes.

    @subsection trigger-persistent The 'persistent' attribute on Trigger

    In the interval between when an Event object <em>triggers</em> (i.e.,
    its Trigger object expression transitions in value from @c false to
    @c true) and when its assignments are to be <em>executed</em>, conditions
    in the model may change such that the trigger expression transitions
    back from @c true to @c false.  Should the event's assignments still be
    made if this happens?  Answering this question is the purpose of the
    'persistent' attribute on Trigger.

    If the boolean attribute 'persistent' has a value of @c true, then once
    the event is triggered, all of its assignments are always performed when
    the time of execution is reached.  The name @em persistent is meant to
    evoke the idea that the trigger expression does not have to be
    re-checked after it triggers if 'persistent'=@c true.  Conversely, if
    the attribute value is @c false, then the trigger expression is not
    assumed to persist: if the expression transitions in value back to @c
    false at any time between when the event triggered and when it is to be
    executed, the event is no longer considered to have triggered and its
    assignments are not executed.  (If the trigger expression transitions
    once more to @c true after that point, then the event is triggered, but
    this then constitutes a whole new event trigger-and-execute sequence.)

    The 'persistent' attribute can be especially useful when Event objects
    contain Delay objects, but it is relevant even in a model without delays
    if the model contains two or more events.  As explained in the
    introduction to this section, the operation of all events in SBML
    (delayed or not) is conceptually divided into two phases,
    <em>triggering</em> and <em>execution</em>; however, unless events have
    priorities associated with them, SBML does not mandate a particular
    ordering of event execution in the case of simultaneous events.  Models
    with multiple events can lead to situations where the execution of one
    event affects another event's trigger expression value.  If that other
    event has 'persistent'=@c false, and its trigger expression evaluates to
    @c false before it is to be executed, the event must not be executed
    after all.

    @subsection trigger-initialvalue The 'initialValue' attribute on Trigger

    As mentioned above, an event <em>triggers</em> when the mathematical
    expression in its Trigger object transitions in value from @c false to
    @c true.  An unanswered question concerns what happens at the start of a
    simulation: can event triggers make this transition at <em>t = 0</em>,
    where <em>t</em> stands for time?

    In order to determine whether an event may trigger at <em>t = 0</em>, it
    is necessary to know what value the Trigger object's 'math' expression
    had immediately prior to <em>t = 0</em>.  This starting value of the
    trigger expression is determined by the value of the boolean attribute
    'initialValue'.  A value of @c true means the trigger expression is
    taken to have the value @c true immediately prior to <em>t = 0</em>.  In
    that case, the trigger cannot transition in value from @c false to @c
    true at the moment simulation begins (because it has the value @c true
    both before and after <em>t = 0</em>), and can only make the transition
    from @c false to @c true sometime <em>after</em> <em>t = 0</em>.  (To do
    that, it would also first have to transition to @c false before it could
    make the transition from @c false back to @c true.)  Conversely, if
    'initialValue'=@c false, then the trigger expression is assumed to start
    with the value @c false, and therefore may trigger at <em>t = 0</em> if
    the expression evaluates to @c true at that moment.

class Delay(SBase):
    """
    LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Delay construct for %Event.

    An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
    are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
    effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
    the condition which invokes it.  An event delay is defined using an
    object of class Delay.

    The object class Delay is derived from SBase and adds a single
    subelement called 'math'.  This subelement is used to hold MathML
    content.  The mathematical formula represented by 'math' must evaluate
    to a numerical value.  It is used as the length of time between when the
    event is @em triggered and when the event's assignments are
    actually @em executed.  If no delay is present on a given Event, a time
    delay of zero is assumed.

    The expression in 'math' must be evaluated at the time the event is @em
    triggered.  The expression must always evaluate to a nonnegative number
    (otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event is
    defined to execute before it is triggered!).

    @section delay-units The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay

    In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the units of the
    numerical value computed by the Delay's 'math' expression are @em
    required to be in units of time, or the model is considered to have a
    unit consistency error.  In Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 as well as SBML
    Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core, this requirement is relaxed; these
    specifications only stipulate that the units of the numerical value
    computed by a Delay instance's 'math' expression @em should match the
    model's units of time (meaning the definition of the @c time units in
    the model).  LibSBML respects these requirements, and depending on
    whether an earlier Version of SBML Level&nbsp;2 is in use, libSBML may
    or may not flag unit inconsistencies as errors or merely warnings.

    Note that <em>units are not predefined or assumed</em> for the contents
    of 'math' in a Delay object; rather, they must be defined explicitly for
    each instance of a Delay object in a model.  This is an important point
    to bear in mind when literal numbers are used in delay expressions.  For
    example, the following Event instance would result in a warning logged
    by SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() about the fact that libSBML cannot
    verify the consistency of the units of the expression.  The reason is
    that the formula inside the 'math' element does not have any declared
    units, whereas what is expected in this context is units of time:
      @verbatim
     <model>
         ...
         <listOfEvents>
             <event useValuesFromTriggerTime='true'>
                 ...
                 <delay>
                     <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
                         <cn> 1 </cn>
                     </math>
                 </delay>
                 ...
             </event>
         </listOfEvents>
         ...
     </model>
     @endverbatim

    The <code>&lt;cn&gt; 1 &lt;/cn&gt;</code> within the mathematical formula
    of the @c delay above has <em>no units declared</em>.  To make the
    expression have the needed units of time, literal numbers should be
    avoided in favor of defining Parameter objects for each quantity, and
    declaring units for the Parameter values.  The following fragment of
    SBML illustrates this approach:
      @verbatim
     <model>
         ...
         <listOfParameters>
             <parameter id='transcriptionDelay' value='10' units='second'/>
         </listOfParameters>
         ...
         <listOfEvents>
             <event useValuesFromTriggerTime='true'>
                 ...
                 <delay>
                     <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
                         <ci> transcriptionDelay </ci>
                     </math>
                 </delay>
                 ...
             </event>
         </listOfEvents>
         ...
     </model>
     @endverbatim

    In SBML Level&nbsp;3, an alternative approach is available in the form
    of the @c units attribute, which SBML Level&nbsp;3 allows to appear on
    MathML @c cn elements.  The value of this attribute can be used to
    indicate the unit of measurement to be associated with the number in the
    content of a @c cn element.  The attribute is named @c units but,
    because it appears inside MathML element (which is in the XML namespace
    for MathML and not the namespace for SBML), it must always be prefixed
    with an XML namespace prefix for the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
    namespace.  The following is an example of this approach:
      @verbatim
     <model timeUnits='second' ...>
         ...
         <listOfEvents>
             <event useValuesFromTriggerTime='true'>
                 ...
                 <delay>

                         <cn sbml:units='second'> 10 </cn>
                     </math>
                 </delay>
                 ...
             </event>

        of measurement assumed for the 'math' expression of this Delay.

        Delay elements in SBML express a time delay for an Event.  Beginning
        with SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, the units of that time are
        calculated based on the mathematical expression and the model
        quantities referenced by <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements used within
        that expression.  The Delay.getDerivedUnitDefinition() method returns
        what libSBML computes the units to be, to the extent that libSBML can
        compute them.

        (Prior to SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2, there existed an attribute
        on Event called 'timeUnits'.  This attribute could be used to set the
        intended units of the delay expression.  For such models, this will
        return a UnitDefinition object that corresponds to the declared
        'timeUnits' units.)

        Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
        on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
        been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
        unit analysis is not possible and this method will return @c None.

        @warning Note that it is possible the 'math' expression in the Delay
        contains literal numbers or parameters with undeclared units.  In
        those cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of the overall
        expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not make
        assumptions about the units, and Delay.getDerivedUnitDefinition()
        only returns the units as far as it is able to determine them.  For
        example, in an expression <em>X + Y</em>, if <em>X</em> has
        unambiguously-defined units and <em>Y</em> does not, it will return
        the units of <em>X</em>.  When using this method, <strong>it is
        critical that callers also invoke the method</strong>
        Delay.containsUndeclaredUnits() <strong>to determine whether this
        situation holds</strong>.  Callers should take suitable action in
        those situations.

        @return a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math 
        expression of this Delay, or @c None if one cannot be constructed.

    LibSBML implementation of %SBML Level 3's %Priority construct
    for Event.

    The Priority object class (which was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3
    Version&nbsp;1), like Delay, is derived from SBase and contains a MathML
    formula stored in the element 'math'.  This formula is used to compute a
    dimensionless numerical value that influences the order in which a
    simulator is to perform the assignments of two or more events that
    happen to be executed simultaneously.  The formula may evaluate to any
    @c double value (and thus may be a positive or negative number, or
    zero), with positive numbers taken to signifying a higher priority than
    zero or negative numbers.  If no Priority object is present on a given
    Event object, no priority is defined for that event.

    @section priority-interp The interpretation of priorities on events in a model

    For the purposes of SBML, <em>simultaneous event execution</em> is
    defined as the situation in which multiple events have identical
    times of execution.  The time of execution is calculated as the
    sum of the time at which a given event's Trigger is <em>triggered</em>
    plus its Delay duration, if any.  Here, <em>identical times</em> means
    <em>mathematically equal</em> instants in time.  (In practice,
    simulation software adhering to this specification may have to
    rely on numerical equality instead of strict mathematical
    equality; robust models will ensure that this difference will not
    cause significant discrepancies from expected behavior.)

    If no Priority subobjects are defined for two or more Event objects,
    then those events are still executed simultaneously but their order of
    execution is <em>undefined by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
    specification</em>.  A software implementation may choose to execute
    such simultaneous events in any order, as long as each event is executed
    only once and the requirements of checking the 'persistent' attribute
    (and acting accordingly) are satisfied.

    If Priority subobjects are defined for two or more
    simultaneously-triggered events, the order in which those particular
    events must be executed is dictated by their Priority objects,
    as follows.  If the values calculated using the two Priority
    objects' 'math' expressions differ, then the event having
    the higher priority value must be executed before the event with
    the lower value.  If, instead, the two priority values are
    mathematically equal, then the two events must be triggered in a
    <em>random</em> order.  It is important to note that a <em>random
      order is not the same as an undefined order</em>: given multiple
    runs of the same model with identical conditions, an undefined
    ordering would permit a system to execute the events in (for
    example) the same order every time (according to whatever scheme
    may have been implemented by the system), whereas the explicit
    requirement for random ordering means that the order of execution
    in different simulation runs depends on random chance.  In other
    words, given two events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, a randomly-determined
    order must lead to an equal chance of executing <em>A</em> first or
    <em>B</em> first, every time those two events are executed
    simultaneously.

    A model may contain a mixture of events, some of which have
    Priority subobjects and some do not.  Should a combination of
    simultaneous events arise in which some events have priorities
    defined and others do not, the set of events with defined
    priorities must trigger in the order determined by their Priority
    objects, and the set of events without Priority objects must be
    executed in an <em>undefined</em> order with respect to each other
    and with respect to the events with Priority subobjects.  (Note
    that <em>undefined order</em> does not necessarily mean random
    order, although a random ordering would be a valid implementation
    of this requirement.)

    The following example may help further clarify these points.
    Suppose a model contains four events that should be executed
    simultaneously, with two of the events having Priority objects
    with the same value and the other two events having Priority
    objects with the same, but different, value.  The two events with
    the higher priorities must be executed first, in a random order
    with respect to each other, and the remaining two events must be
    executed after them, again in a random order, for a total of four
    possible and equally-likely event executions: A-B-C-D, A-B-D-C,
    B-A-C-D, and B-A-D-C.  If, instead, the model contains four events
    all having the same Priority values, there are 4! or 24
    possible orderings, each of which must be equally likely to be
    chosen.  Finally, if none of the four events has a Priority
    subobject defined, or even if exactly one of the four events has a
    defined Priority, there are again 24 possible orderings, but the
    likelihood of choosing any particular ordering is undefined; the
    simulator can choose between events as it wishes.  (The SBML
    specification only defines the effects of priorities on Event
    objects with respect to <em>other</em> Event objects with
    priorities.  Putting a priority on a <em>single</em> Event object
    in a model does not cause it to fall within that scope.)

    @section priority-eval Evaluation of Priority expressions

    An event's Priority object 'math' expression must be
    evaluated at the time the Event is to be <em>executed</em>.  During
    a simulation, all simultaneous events have their Priority values
    calculated, and the event with the highest priority is selected for
    next execution.  Note that it is possible for the execution of one
    Event object to cause the Priority value of another
    simultaneously-executing Event object to change (as well as to
    trigger other events, as already noted).  Thus, after executing
    one event, and checking whether any other events in the model have
    been triggered, all remaining simultaneous events that
    <em>either</em> (i) have Trigger objects with attributes
    'persistent'=@c false <em>or</em> (ii) have Trigger
    expressions that did not transition from @c true to
    @c false, must have their Priority expression reevaluated.
    The highest-priority remaining event must then be selected for 
    execution next.

    @section priority-units Units of Priority object's mathematical expressions

    The unit associated with the value of a Priority object's
    'math' expression should be @c dimensionless.  This is
    because the priority expression only serves to provide a relative
    ordering between different events, and only has meaning with
    respect to other Priority object expressions.  The value of
    Priority objects is not comparable to any other kind of object in
    an SBML model.

    @note The Priority construct exists only in SBML Level&nbsp;3; it cannot
    be used in SBML Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;1 models.

    The values of 'id' attributes on SBML components allow the components to
    be cross-referenced within a model. The values of 'name' attributes on
    SBML components provide the opportunity to assign them meaningful labels
    suitable for display to humans.  The specific identifiers and labels
    used in a model necessarily must be unrestricted by SBML, so that
    software and users are free to pick whatever they need.  However, this
    freedom makes it more difficult for software tools to determine, without
    additional human intervention, the semantics of models more precisely
    than the semantics provided by the SBML object classes defined in other
    sections of this document.  For example, there is nothing inherent in a
    parameter with identifier <code>k</code> that would indicate to a
    software tool it is a first-order rate constant (if that's what
    <code>k</code> happened to be in some given model).  However, one may
    need to convert a model between different representations (e.g.,
    Henri-Michaelis-Menten versus elementary steps), or to use it with
    different modeling approaches (discrete or continuous).  One may also
    need to relate the model components with other description formats such
    as SBGN (<a target='_blank'
    href='http://www.sbgn.org/'>http://www.sbgn.org/</a>) using deeper
    semantics.  Although an advanced software tool <em>might</em> be able to
    deduce the semantics of some model components through detailed analysis
    of the kinetic rate expressions and other parts of the model, this
    quickly becomes infeasible for any but the simplest of models.

    An approach to solving this problem is to associate model components
    with terms from carefully curated controlled vocabularies (CVs).  This
    is the purpose of the optional 'sboTerm' attribute provided on the SBML
    class SBase.  The 'sboTerm' attribute always refers to terms belonging
    to the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO).

    allows a software tool to identify each component using identifiers that
    are not tool-specific.  An example of where this is useful is the desire
    by many software developers to provide users with meaningful names for
    reaction rate equations.  Software tools with editing interfaces
    frequently provide these names in menus or lists of choices for users.
    However, without a standardized set of names or identifiers shared
    between developers, a given software package cannot reliably interpret
    the names or identifiers of reactions used in models written by other
    tools.

    The first solution that might come to mind is to stipulate that certain
    common reactions always have the same name (e.g., 'Michaelis-Menten'), but
    this is simply impossible to do: not only do humans often disagree on
    the names themselves, but it would not allow for correction of errors or
    updates to the list of predefined names except by issuing new releases
    of the SBML specification&mdash;to say nothing of many other limitations
    with this approach.  Moreover, the parameters and variables that appear
    in rate expressions also need to be identified in a way that software
    tools can interpret mechanically, implying that the names of these
    entities would also need to be regulated.

    The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides terms for identifying most
    elements of SBML. The relationship implied by an 'sboTerm' on an SBML
    model component is <em>is-a</em> between the characteristic of the
    component meant to be described by %SBO on this element and the %SBO
    term identified by the value of the 'sboTerm'. By adding %SBO term
    references on the components of a model, a software tool can provide
    additional details using independent, shared vocabularies that can
    enable <em>other</em> software tools to recognize precisely what the
    component is meant to be.  Those tools can then act on that information.
    For example, if the %SBO identifier @c 'SBO:0000049' is assigned
    to the concept of 'first-order irreversible mass-action kinetics,
    continuous framework', and a given KineticLaw object in a model has an
    'sboTerm' attribute with this value, then regardless of the identifier
    and name given to the reaction itself, a software tool could use this to
    inform users that the reaction is a first-order irreversible mass-action
    reaction.  This kind of reverse engineering of the meaning of reactions
    in a model would be difficult to do otherwise, especially for more
    complex reaction types.

    The presence of %SBO labels on Compartment, Species, and Reaction
    objects in SBML can help map those entities to equivalent concepts in
    other standards, such as (but not limited to) BioPAX (<a target='_blank'
    href='http://www.biopax.org/'>http://www.biopax.org/</a>), PSI-MI (<a
    target='_blank'
    href='http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/60'>http://www.psidev.info</a>),
    or the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, <a target='_blank'
    href='http://www.sbgn.org/'>http://www.sbgn.org/</a>).  Such mappings
    can be used in conversion procedures, or to build interfaces, with %SBO
    becoming a kind of 'glue' between standards of representation.

    The presence of the label on a kinetic expression can also allow
    software tools to make more intelligent decisions about reaction rate
    expressions.  For example, an application could recognize certain types
    of reaction formulas as being ones it knows how to solve with optimized
    procedures.  The application could then use internal, optimized code
    implementing the rate formula indexed by identifiers such as
    @c 'SBO:0000049' appearing in SBML models.

    Finally, %SBO labels may be very valuable when it comes to model
    integration, by helping identify interfaces, convert mathematical
    expressions and parameters etc.

    Although the use of %SBO can be beneficial, it is critical to keep in
    mind that the presence of an 'sboTerm' value on an object <em>must not
    change the fundamental mathematical meaning</em> of the model.  An SBML
    model must be defined such that it stands on its own and does not depend
    on additional information added by %SBO terms for a correct mathematical
    interpretation.  %SBO term definitions will not imply any alternative
    mathematical semantics for any SBML object labeled with that term.  Two
    important reasons motivate this principle.  First, it would be too
    limiting to require all software tools to be able to understand the %SBO
    vocabularies in addition to understanding SBML.  Supporting %SBO is not
    only additional work for the software developer; for some kinds of
    applications, it may not make sense.  If %SBO terms on a model are
    optional, it follows that the SBML model <em>must</em> remain
    unambiguous and fully interpretable without them, because an application
    reading the model may ignore the terms.  Second, we believe allowing the
    use of 'sboTerm' to alter the mathematical meaning of a model would
    allow too much leeway to shoehorn inconsistent concepts into SBML
    objects, ultimately reducing the interoperability of the models.

    @section relationship Relationships between SBO and SBML

    The goal of %SBO labeling for SBML is to clarify to the fullest extent
    possible the nature of each element in a model.  The approach taken in
    %SBO begins with a hierarchically-structured set of controlled
    vocabularies with six main divisions: (1) entity, (2) participant role,
    (3) quantitative parameter, (4) modeling framework, (5) mathematical
    expression, and (6) interaction.  The web site for %SBO (<a
    target='_blank'
    href='http://biomodels.net/sbo'>http://biomodels.net</a>) should be
    consulted for the current version of the ontology.

    The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) is not part of SBML; it is being
    developed separately, to allow the modeling community to evolve the
    ontology independently of SBML.  However, the terms in the ontology are
    being designed keeping SBML components in mind, and are classified into
    subsets that can be directly related with SBML components such as
    reaction rate expressions, parameters, and others.  The use of 'sboTerm'
    attributes is optional, and the presence of 'sboTerm' on an element does
    not change the way the model is <em>interpreted</em>.  Annotating SBML
    elements with %SBO terms adds additional semantic information that may
    be used to <em>convert</em> the model into another model, or another
    format.  Although %SBO support provides an important source of
    information to understand the meaning of a model, software does not need
    to support 'sboTerm' to be considered SBML-compliant.

        href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/'>XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (which is
        simply an XML-ized version of HTML).  However, the content cannot be

        the <a target='_blank'
        href='http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications'>SBML

        verification process that lets callers check whether the content of a
        given XMLNode object conforms to the SBML requirements for 'notes' and
        'message' structure.

        An aspect of XHTML validity is that the content is declared to be in
        the XML namespace for XHTML&nbsp;1.0.  There is more than one way in
        which this can be done in XML.  In particular, a model might not
        contain the declaration within the 'notes' or 'message' subelement
        itself, but might instead place the declaration on an enclosing
        element and use an XML namespace prefix within the 'notes' element to
        refer to it.  In other words, the following is valid:
          @verbatim
         <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'
               xmlns:xhtml='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>

             <notes>
               <xhtml:body>
                 <xhtml:center><xhtml:h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</xhtml:h2></xhtml:center>

             </notes>
           ... rest of model ...
         </sbml>
         @endverbatim
        Contrast the above with the following, self-contained version, which
        places the XML namespace declaration within the <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code>
        element itself:
          @verbatim
         <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'>
           <model>
             <notes>
               <html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
                 <head>
                   <title/>
                 </head>
                 <body>

         @endverbatim

        Both of the above are valid XML.  The purpose of the @p sbmlns
        argument to this method is to allow callers to check the validity of
        'notes' and 'message' subelements whose XML namespace declarations
        have been put elsewhere in the manner illustrated above.  Callers can
        can pass in the SBMLNamespaces object of a higher-level model

    href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/'>XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (which is
    simply an XML-ized version of HTML).  However, the content cannot be
    @em entirely free-form; it must satisfy certain requirements defined in
    the <a target='_blank'
    href='http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications'>SBML
    specifications</a> for specific SBML Levels.  This method implements a
    verification process that lets callers check whether the content of a
    given XMLNode object conforms to the SBML requirements for 'notes' and
    'message' structure.

    An aspect of XHTML validity is that the content is declared to be in
    the XML namespace for XHTML&nbsp;1.0.  There is more than one way in
    which this can be done in XML.  In particular, a model might not
    contain the declaration within the 'notes' or 'message' subelement
    itself, but might instead place the declaration on an enclosing
    element and use an XML namespace prefix within the 'notes' element to
    refer to it.  In other words, the following is valid:
      @verbatim
     <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'
           xmlns:xhtml='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
       <model>
         <notes>
           <xhtml:body>
             <xhtml:center><xhtml:h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</xhtml:h2></xhtml:center>
             <xhtml:p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</xhtml:p>
           </xhtml:body>
         </notes>
       ... rest of model ...
     </sbml>
     @endverbatim
    Contrast the above with the following, self-contained version, which
    places the XML namespace declaration within the <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code>
    element itself:
      @verbatim
     <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'>
       <model>
         <notes>
           <html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
             <head>
               <title/>
             </head>
             <body>
               <center><h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</h2></center>
               <p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</p>
             </body>
           </html>
         </notes>
       ... rest of model ...
     </sbml>
     @endverbatim

    Both of the above are valid XML.  The purpose of the @p sbmlns
    argument to this method is to allow callers to check the validity of
    'notes' and 'message' subelements whose XML namespace declarations
    have been put elsewhere in the manner illustrated above.  Callers can
    can pass in the SBMLNamespaces object of a higher-level model
    component if the XMLNode object does not itself have the XML namespace
    declaration for XHTML&nbsp;1.0.

    @param xhtml the XMLNode to be checked for conformance.

    @section l2-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 2

    In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
    using @em either the 'stoichiometry' attribute or a 'stoichiometryMath'
    element in a SpeciesReference object.  The 'stoichiometry' attribute is
    of type @c double and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
    'stoichiometryMath' element is implemented as an element containing a
    MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
    'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' should be defined in a given
    SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
    is present, the value of 'stoichiometry' in the enclosing
    SpeciesReference instance defaults to @c 1.

    For maximum interoperability, SpeciesReference's 'stoichiometry'
    attribute should be used in preference to 'stoichiometryMath' when a
    species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).
    When the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more
    complicated formula, 'stoichiometryMath' must be used.  The MathML
    expression in 'stoichiometryMath' may also refer to identifiers of
    entities in a model (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only
    species identifiers that can be used in 'stoichiometryMath' are those
    referenced in the enclosing Reaction's list of reactants, products and
    modifiers.

    The 'stoichiometry' attribute and the 'stoichiometryMath' element, when
    either is used, is each interpreted as a factor applied to the reaction
    rate to produce the rate of change of the species identified by the
    'species' attribute in the enclosing SpeciesReference.  This is the
    normal interpretation of a stoichiometry, but in SBML, one additional
    consideration has to be taken into account.  The reaction rate, which is
    the result of the KineticLaw's 'math' element, is always in the model's
    @em substance per @em time units.  However, the rate of change of the
    species will involve the species' @em substance units (i.e., the units
    identified by the Species object's 'substanceUnits' attribute), and
    these units may be different from the model's default @em substance
    units.  If the units @em are different, the stoichiometry must
    incorporate a conversion factor for converting the model's @em substance
    units to the species' @em substance units.  The conversion factor is
    assumed to be included in the scalar value of the 'stoichiometry'
    attribute if 'stoichiometry' is used.  If instead 'stoichiometryMath' is
    used, then the product of the model's 'substance' units times the
    'stoichiometryMath' units must match the @em substance units of the
    species.  Note that in either case, if the species' units and the
    model's default @em substance units are the same, the stoichiometry ends
    up being a dimensionless number and equivalent to the standard chemical
    stoichiometry found in textbooks.  Examples and more explanations of
    this are given in the SBML specification.

    The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
    'X0', with stoichiometry @c 2, in a list of reactants within a reaction
    having the identifier @c 'J1':
    @code
    <model>
        ...
        <listOfReactions>
            <reaction id='J1'>
                <listOfReactants>
                    <speciesReference species='X0' stoichiometry='2'>
                </listOfReactants>

            </reaction>
            ...
        </listOfReactions>
        ...
    </model>
    @endcode

    The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
    species @c 'X0', with a stoichiometry formula consisting of
    a rational number:
    @code
    <model>
        ...
        <listOfReactions>
            <reaction id='J1'>
                <listOfReactants>
                    <speciesReference species='X0'>
                        <stoichiometryMath>
                            <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>

    @section l3-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 3

    The StoichiometryMath construct is not defined in SBML Level&nbsp;3
    Version&nbsp;1 Core.  Instead, Level&nbsp;3 defines the identifier of
    SpeciesReference objects as a stand-in for the stoichiometry of the
    reactant or product being referenced, and allows that identifier to be
    used elsewhere in SBML models, including (for example) InitialAssignment
    objects.  This makes it possible to achieve the same effect as
    StoichiometryMath, but with other SBML objects.  For instance, to
    produce a stoichiometry value that is a rational number, a model can use
    InitialAssignment to assign the identifier of a SpeciesReference object
    to a MathML expression evaluating to a rational number.  This is
    analogous to the same way that, in Level&nbsp;2, the model would use
    StoichiometryMath with a MathML expression evaluating to a rational
    number.

    In SBML Level 2, the stoichiometry of a reactant or product is a
    combination of both a <em>biochemical stoichiometry</em> (meaning, the
    standard stoichiometry of a species in a reaction) and any necessary
    unit conversion factors. The introduction of an explicit attribute on
    the Species object for a conversion factor allows Level&nbsp;3 to avoid
    having to overload the meaning of stoichiometry.  In Level&nbsp;3, the
    stoichiometry given by a SpeciesReference object in a reaction is a
    'proper' biochemical stoichiometry, meaning a dimensionless number free
    of unit conversions.

    Class to store SBML level, version and namespace information.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    There are differences in the definitions of components between different
    SBML Levels, as well as Versions within Levels.  For example, the
    'sboTerm' attribute was not introduced until Level&nbsp;2
    Version&nbsp;2, and then only on certain component classes; the SBML
    Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3 specification moved the 'sboTerm' attribute
    to the SBase class, thereby allowing nearly all components to have SBO
    annotations.  As a result of differences such as those, libSBML needs to
    track the SBML Level and Version of every object created.

    The purpose of the SBMLNamespaces object class is to make it easier to
    communicate SBML Level and Version data between libSBML constructors and
    other methods.  The SBMLNamespaces object class tracks 3-tuples
    (triples) consisting of SBML Level, Version, and the corresponding SBML
    XML namespace.

    The plural name (SBMLNamespaces) is not a mistake, because in SBML
    Level&nbsp;3, objects may have extensions added by Level&nbsp;3 packages
    used by a given model and therefore may have multiple namespaces
    associated with them; however, until the introduction of SBML
    Level&nbsp;3, the SBMLNamespaces object only records one SBML
    Level/Version/namespace combination at a time.  Most constructors for
    SBML objects in libSBML take a SBMLNamespaces object as an argument,
    thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of
    attributes and other internal data structures for the given SBML Level
    and Version.

    Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of a
    mathematical expression.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are a simple kind of data structure used in
    libSBML for storing mathematical expressions.  The ASTNode is the
    cornerstone of libSBML's AST representation.  An AST 'node' represents the
    most basic, indivisible part of a mathematical formula and come in many
    types.  For instance, there are node types to represent numbers (with
    subtypes to distinguish integer, real, and rational numbers), names
    (e.g., constants or variables), simple mathematical operators, logical
    or relational operators and functions. LibSBML ASTs provide a canonical,
    in-memory representation for all mathematical formulas regardless of
    their original format (which might be MathML or might be text strings).

    An AST @em node in libSBML is a recursive structure containing a pointer
    to the node's value (which might be, for example, a number or a symbol)
    and a list of children nodes.  Each ASTNode node may have none, one,
    two, or more children depending on its type.  The following diagram
    illustrates an example of how the mathematical expression <code>'1 +
    2'</code> is represented as an AST with one @em plus node having two @em
    integer children nodes for the numbers <code>1</code> and
    <code>2</code>.  The figure also shows the corresponding MathML
    representation:

    @htmlinclude astnode-illustration.html

    The following are other noteworthy points about the AST representation
    in libSBML:
    <ul>
    <li> A numerical value represented in MathML as a real number with an
    exponent is preserved as such in the AST node representation, even if
    the number could be stored in a @c double data type.  This is done
    so that when an SBML model is read in and then written out again, the
    amount of change introduced by libSBML to the SBML during the round-trip
    activity is minimized.
     
    <li> Rational numbers are represented in an AST node using separate
    numerator and denominator values.  These can be retrieved using the
    methods ASTNode.getNumerator() and ASTNode.getDenominator().

    <li> The children of an ASTNode are other ASTNode objects.  The list of
    children is empty for nodes that are leaf elements, such as numbers.
    For nodes that are actually roots of expression subtrees, the list of
    children points to the parsed objects that make up the rest of the
    expression.
    </ul>

    ASTNodeType_t</a></h3> @else <h3><a class='anchor'
    name='ASTNodeType_t'>The set of possible %ASTNode types</a></h3> @endif

    @if clike Every ASTNode has an associated type code to indicate,
    for example, whether it holds a number or stands for an arithmetic
    operator.  The type is recorded as a value drawn from the enumeration 
    @link ASTNode.h::ASTNodeType_t ASTNodeType_t@endlink.  The list of
    possible types is quite long, because it covers all the mathematical
    functions that are permitted in SBML.  The values are shown in the
    following table: @else Every ASTNode has an associated
    type code to indicate, for example, whether it holds a number or stands for
    an arithmetic operator.  The type is recorded as a value drawn from a
    set of static integer constants defined in the class {@link
    libsbmlConstants}.  Their names begin with the characters @c AST_.  The
    list of possible types is quite long, because it covers all the
    mathematical functions that are permitted in SBML.  The values are shown
    in the following table: @endif

    @htmlinclude astnode-types.html

    The types have the following meanings:
    <ul>
    <li> If the node is basic mathematical operator (e.g., @c '+'), then the
    node's type will be @c AST_PLUS, @c AST_MINUS, @c AST_TIMES, @c AST_DIVIDE,
    or @c AST_POWER, as appropriate.

    <li> If the node is a predefined function or operator from %SBML Level&nbsp;1
    (in the string-based formula syntax used in Level&nbsp;1) or %SBML Levels&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3
    (in the subset of MathML used in SBML Levels&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3), then the node's type
    will be either <code>AST_FUNCTION_</code><em><span
    class='placeholder'>X</span></em>, <code>AST_LOGICAL_</code><em><span
    class='placeholder'>X</span></em>, or
    <code>AST_RELATIONAL_</code><em><span class='placeholder'>X</span></em>,
    as appropriate.  (Examples: @c AST_FUNCTION_LOG, @c AST_RELATIONAL_LEQ.)

    <li> If the node refers to a user-defined function, the node's type will
    be @c AST_NAME (because it holds the name of the function).

    <li> If the node is a lambda expression, its type will be @c AST_LAMBDA.

    <li> If the node is a predefined constant (@c 'ExponentialE', @c 'Pi', 
    @c 'True' or @c 'False'), then the node's type will be @c AST_CONSTANT_E,
    @c AST_CONSTANT_PI, @c AST_CONSTANT_TRUE, or @c AST_CONSTANT_FALSE.

    <li> (Levels&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3 only) If the node is the special MathML csymbol @c time,
    the value of the node will be @c AST_NAME_TIME.  (Note, however, that the
    MathML csymbol @c delay is translated into a node of type
    @c AST_FUNCTION_DELAY.  The difference is due to the fact that @c time is a
    single variable, whereas @c delay is actually a function taking
    arguments.)

    <li> (Level&nbsp;3 only) If the node is the special MathML csymbol @c avogadro,
    the value of the node will be @c AST_NAME_AVOGADRO.

    <li> If the node contains a numerical value, its type will be
    @c AST_INTEGER, @c AST_REAL, @c AST_REAL_E, or @c AST_RATIONAL,
    as appropriate.

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas produced by @if clike SBML_formulaToString()@endif@if csharp SBML_formulaToString()@else <code><a href='libsbml.html#formulaToString(org.sbml.libsbml.ASTNode)'>libsbml.formulaToString()</a></code>@endif and

    are simple C-inspired infix notation taken from SBML Level&nbsp;1.  A
    formula in this text-string form can be handed to a program that
    understands SBML Level&nbsp;1 mathematical expressions, or used as part
    of a translation system.  The libSBML distribution comes with an example
    program in the @c 'examples' subdirectory called @c translateMath that
    implements an interactive command-line demonstration of translating
    infix formulas into MathML and vice-versa.

    The formula strings may contain operators, function calls, symbols, and
    white space characters.  The allowable white space characters are tab
    and space.  The following are illustrative examples of formulas
    expressed in the syntax:

      @verbatim
     0.10 * k4^2
     @endverbatim
      @verbatim
     (vm * s1)/(km + s1)
     @endverbatim

    The following table shows the precedence rules in this syntax.  In the
    Class column, @em operand implies the construct is an operand, @em
    prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments, @em
    unary implies there is one argument, and @em binary implies there are
    two arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order
    of different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
    expression <em>a * b + c</em> is evaluated as <em>(a * b) + c</em>
    because the <code>*</code> operator has higher precedence.  The
    Associates column shows how the order of similar precedence operations
    is determined; for example, <em>a - b + c</em> is evaluated as <em>(a -
    b) + c</em> because the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> operators are
    left-associative.  The precedence and associativity rules are taken from
    the C programming language, except for the symbol <code>^</code>, which
    is used in C for a different purpose.  (Exponentiation can be invoked
    using either <code>^</code> or the function @c power.)

    @htmlinclude math-precedence-table.html 

    A program parsing a formula in an SBML model should assume that names
    appearing in the formula are the identifiers of Species, Parameter,
    Compartment, FunctionDefinition, Reaction (in SBML Levels&nbsp;2
    and&nbsp;3), or SpeciesReference (in SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) objects
    defined in a model.  When a function call is involved, the syntax
    consists of a function identifier, followed by optional white space,
    followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by a sequence of zero or
    more arguments separated by commas (with each comma optionally preceded
    and/or followed by zero or more white space characters), followed by a
    closing parenthesis.  There is an almost one-to-one mapping between the
    list of predefined functions available, and those defined in MathML.
    All of the MathML functions are recognized; this set is larger than the
    functions defined in SBML Level&nbsp;1.  In the subset of functions that
    overlap between MathML and SBML Level&nbsp;1, there exist a few
    differences.  The following table summarizes the differences between the
    predefined functions in SBML Level&nbsp;1 and the MathML equivalents in
    SBML Levels&nbsp;2 and &nbsp;3:

    correspond to the parts of a namespace declaration on an XML element.
    For example, in the following XML fragment,

    """
    Representation of a node in an XML document tree.

    Beginning with version 3.0.0, libSBML implements an XML abstraction
    layer.  This layer presents a uniform XML interface to calling programs
    regardless of which underlying XML parser libSBML has actually been
    configured to use.  The basic data object in the XML abstraction is a
    @em node, represented by XMLNode.

    An XMLNode can contain any number of children.  Each child is another
    XMLNode, thereby forming a tree.  The methods XMLNode.getNumChildren()
    and XMLNode.getChild() can be used to access the tree
    structure starting from a given node.

    Each XMLNode is subclassed from XMLToken, and thus has the same methods
    available as XMLToken.  These methods include XMLToken.getNamespaces(),
    XMLToken.getPrefix(), XMLToken.getName(), XMLToken.getURI(), and
    XMLToken.getAttributes().

    @section xmlnode-str2xmlnode Conversion between an XML string and an XMLNode

    LibSBML provides the following utility functions for converting an XML
    string (e.g., <code>&lt;annotation&gt;...&lt;/annotation&gt;</code>)
    to/from an XMLNode object.
    <ul>
    <li> XMLNode.toXMLString() returns a string representation of the XMLNode object. 

    <li> XMLNode.convertXMLNodeToString()
    (static function) returns a string representation 
    of the given XMLNode object.

    <li> XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode()
    (static function) returns an XMLNode object converted 
    from the given XML string.
    </ul>

    The returned XMLNode object by XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode()
    is a dummy root (container) XMLNode if the given XML string has two or
    more top-level elements (e.g.,
    &quot;<code>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>&quot;). In the
    dummy root node, each top-level element in the given XML string is
    contained as a child XMLNode. XMLToken.isEOF() can be used to identify
    if the returned XMLNode object is a dummy node or not.  Here is an
    example: @if clike
      @verbatim
     // Checks if the XMLNode object returned by XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode() is a dummy root node:
                                                                                              
     string str = '...'; 
     XMLNode xn = XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode();                                      
     if ( xn == None )
     {                                                                                      
       // returned value is null (error)

    A 'triple' in the libSBML XML layer encapsulates the notion of qualified

    namespace qualifier.  An XMLTriple instance carries up to three data items:

    as it appears in an XML document or data stream;

    <li> The XML namespace prefix (if any) of the attribute.  For example,

    <code>mysim</code> and it appears on both the element
    <code>someelement</code> and the attribute <code>attribA</code>.  When

    Representation of errors, warnings and other diagnostics

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    LibSBML can be configured to use any of a number of XML parsers; at the
    time of this writing, libSBML supports Xerces versions 2.4 through 3.1,
    Expat version 1.95.x and higher, and libxml2 version 2.6.16 and higher.
    These parsers each report different status codes for the various
    exceptions that can occur during XML processing.  The XMLError object
    class abstracts away from the particular diagnostics reported by the
    different parsers and presents a single uniform interface and set of
    status codes, along with operations for manipulating the error objects.

    When the libSBML XML parser layer encounters an error in the XML content
    being processed, or when there is something else wrong (such as an
    out-of-memory condition), the problems are reported as XMLError objects.
    Each XMLError object instance has an identification number that
    identifies the nature of the problem.
    @if clike This error identifier will be up to five digits 
    long and drawn from the enumeration <a class='el'
    href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>XMLErrorCode_t</a>.  Applications can use the
    error identifiers as a means of recognizing the error encountered and
    changing their behavior if desired. @else This
    error identifier is one of the constants listed in the next section below.
    Applications can use the error identifiers as a means of recognizing the
    error encountered and changing their behavior if desired.  @endif

    Integer error codes are useful for software, but not so much for telling
    humans what happened.  For this reason, XMLError also provides two text
    messages describing the nature of the error.  These messages are
    accessible by means of the methods XMLError.getShortMessage() and
    XMLError.getMessage().  The method XMLError.getShortMessage() returns
    a very brief synopsis of the warning or error condition, whereas
    XMLError.getMessage() returns a longer explanation.  These text strings
    are suitable for displaying to human users.

    Each XMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
    retrieved using the method XMLError.getCategory().  Category values
    are drawn from @if clike the enumeration <a class='el' href='#XMLErrorCategory_t'>XMLErrorCategory_t</a> described below.@else a
    set of constants whose names begin with the characters @c LIBSBML_CAT_, described below.@endif &nbsp;Categories
    are used by libSBML to provide more information to calling programs about
    the nature of a given error.  

    In addition to category codes, each XMLError object also has a severity
    code; its value may be retrieved using the method
    XMLError.getSeverity().  Severity code values are drawn from
    @if clike the enumeration <a class='el' href='#XMLErrorSeverity_t'>XMLErrorSeverity_t</a>@else a
    set of constants whose names begin with the characters @c LIBSBML_SEV_@endif,
    described below. Severity levels range from informational
    (@link libsbml.LIBSBML_SEV_INFO LIBSBML_SEV_INFO@endlink) to
    fatal errors (@link libsbml.LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL@endlink).

    Finally, XMLError objects record the line and column near where the
    problem occurred in the XML content.  The values can be retrieved using
    the methods XMLError.getLine() and XMLError.getColumn().  We say 'near
    where the problem occurred', because many factors affect how accurate
    the line/column information ultimately is.  For example, different XML
    parsers have different conventions for which line and column number they
    report for a particular problem (which in turn makes a difference when a
    problem involves an opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on
    another line).  In some situations, some parsers report invalid line
    and/or column numbers altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line
    and/or column number in the XMLError object to the the value of the
    maximum unsigned long integer representable on the platform where
    libSBML is running.  (This is equal to the constant named
    <code>ULONG_MAX</code> in C and C++.)  The probability that a true line
    or column number in an SBML model would equal this value is vanishingly
    small; thus, if an application encounters these values in an XMLError
    object, it can assume no valid line/column number could be provided by
    libSBML in that situation.

        This method has multiple variants that differ in the arguments they accept.  Each is described separately below.

        <hr>
        Method variant with the following signature:
        <pre class='signature'>XMLError( const int errorId           = 0 , string details  = '' , const long line     = 0 , const long column   = 0 , const long severity = LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL , const long category = LIBSBML_CAT_INTERNAL )</pre>

        Creates a new XMLError to report that something occurred during XML
        processing.

        XMLError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature of
        the exception.  @if clike These numbers are drawn from
        the enumeration <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>XMLErrorCode_t</a>.
        @else These numbers are defined as unsigned 
        integer constants in the file
        'libsbmlConstants.java'.  See the <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>top of this documentation</a> for a table
        listing the possible values and their meanings. @endif The argument @p
        errorId to this constructor @em can be (but does not have to be) a
        value from this @if clike enumeration. If it is a value
        from <a class='el' href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>XMLErrorCode_t</a>, the
        XMLError class assumes the error is a low-level system or XML layer
        error and <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to
        any string passed in the argument @p details to this constructor.  In
        addition, all <a class='el' href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>XMLErrorCode_t</a>
        errors have associated values for the @p severity and @p category
        codes, and these fields are filled-in as well from the enumerations <a
        class='el' href='#XMLErrorSeverity_t'>XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a
        class='el' href='#XMLErrorCategory_t'>XMLErrorCategory_t</a>,
        respectively. @else set of constants.  If it is
        one of the predefined error identifiers, the XMLError class assumes
        the error is a low-level system or XML layer error and
        <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to any string
        passed in the argument @p details to this constructor.  In addition,
        all the predefined error identifiers have associated values for the @p
        severity and @p category codes, and these fields are filled-in as
        well. @endif

        If the error identifier @p errorId is a number greater than 9999, this
        constructor assumes that the error was generated from another part of
        the software, and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
        the defaults in the constructor itself.  This allows XMLError to serve
        as a base class for other errors (and is used in this way elsewhere in
        libSBML).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with suitable
        values if generating errors with codes greater than 9999 to make
        maximum use of the XMLError facilities.

        @if clike As mentioned above, there are two other
        enumerations, <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorSeverity_t'>XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorCategory_t'>XMLErrorCategory_t</a>, used for indicating
        the severity and category of error for the predefined XMLError codes.
        The values passed in @p severity and @p category override the defaults
        assigned based on the error code.  If the value of @p errorId is a
        value from <a class='el' href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>XMLErrorCode_t</a>,
        callers do not need to fill in @p severity and @p category.
        Conversely, if @p errorId is not a value from <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorCode_t'>XMLErrorCode_t</a>, callers can use other
        values (not just those from <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorSeverity_t'>XMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorCategory_t'>XMLErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
        special values) for @p severity and @p
        category. @else As mentioned above, 
        there are additional constants defined for <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorSeverity_t'>standard severity</a> and <a class='el'
        href='#XMLErrorCategory_t'>standard category</a> codes, and every predefined 
        error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category taken
        from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
        prefixed with <code>LIBSBML_SEV_</code> and <code>LIBSBML_CAT_</code>,
        respectively.  If the value of @p errorId is one of the standard error
        codes, callers do not need to fill in @p severity and @p category in a
        call to this constructor.  Conversely, if @p errorId is not an existing
        XML-level error code, callers can use other values for @p severity and
        @p category. @endif

        @param errorId a long integer, the identification number of the error.

        @param details a string containing additional details about the error.
        If the error code in @p errorId is one that is recognized by XMLError,
        the given message is @em appended to a predefined message associated
        with the given code.  If the error code is not recognized, the message
        is stored as-is as the text of the error.

        @param line a long integer, the line number at which the error occured.

        @param column a long integer, the column number at which the error occured.

        @param severity an integer indicating severity of the error.

        @param category an integer indicating the category to which the error
        belongs.

    The error log is a list.  The XML layer of libSBML maintains an error
    log associated with a given XML document or data stream.  When an
    operation results in an error, or when there is something wrong with the
    XML content, the problem is reported as an XMLError object stored in the

    object instances it contains, and then to iterate over the list of
    objects one at a time using getError(long n) const.  Indexing in
    the list begins at 0.

    In normal circumstances, programs using libSBML will actually obtain an
    SBMLErrorLog rather than an XMLErrorLog.  The former is subclassed from
    XMLErrorLog and simply wraps commands for working with SBMLError objects

    The error log is a list.  Each SBMLDocument maintains its own
    SBMLErrorLog.  When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an
    error, or when there is something worth noting about the SBML content,
    the issue is reported as an SBMLError object stored in the SBMLErrorLog
    list.

    SBMLErrorLog is derived from XMLErrorLog, an object class that serves
    exactly the same purpose but for the XML parsing layer.  XMLErrorLog
    provides crucial methods such as
    @if java XMLErrorLog.getNumErrors()@else getNumErrors()@endif
    for determining how many SBMLError or XMLError objects are in the log.
    SBMLErrorLog inherits these methods.

    The general approach to working with SBMLErrorLog in user programs
    involves first obtaining a pointer to a log from a libSBML object such
    as SBMLDocument.  Callers should then use
    @if java XMLErrorLog.getNumErrors()@else getNumErrors() @endif to inquire how
    many objects there are in the list.  (The answer may be 0.)  If there is
    at least one SBMLError object in the SBMLErrorLog instance, callers can
    then iterate over the list using
    SBMLErrorLog.getError()@if clike const@endif,
    using methods provided by the SBMLError class to find out the error code
    and associated information such as the error severity, the message, and
    the line number in the input.

    If you wish to simply print the error strings for a human to read, an
    easier and more direct way might be to use SBMLDocument.printErrors().

    Representation of errors, warnings and other diagnostics

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an error, or when
    there is something wrong with the SBML content, the problems are
    reported as SBMLError objects.  These are generally stored in an
    SBMLErrorLog object; this log object, in turn, is kept in the
    SBMLDocument object containing the SBML content.  Applications can
    obtain the list of logged errors using SBMLDocument.getErrorLog() and
    then use the methods provided by SBMLErrorLog to access individual
    SBMLError objects.  (Note that despite the word 'error' in the name,
    SBMLError objects are used to represent not only 'true' errors, but also
    warnings and some informational diagnostics.  The name is a historical
    hold-over from early versions of libSBML, in which the object really was
    only used to report errors.)

    @if clike
    Each SBMLError object instance has an identification number that
    identifies the nature of the problem.  This 'error id' number will be up
    to five digits long, and it will be listed in one of two enumerations:
    <a class='el' href='#SBMLErrorCode_t'> SBMLErrorCode_t</a> (described <a
    class='el' href='#SBMLErrorCode_t'> below</a>) or @link
    XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink (described in the
    documentation for the class XMLError).  The former enumeration contains
    all the SBML validation rule numbers listed in the appendices of the
    SBML specification documents, as well as some additional
    libSBML-specific error codes.

    Error codes are useful mainly for software.  For human readers,
    SBMLError also includes text messages that describe the nature of a
    given problem.  The messages can be accessed using
    SBMLError.getShortMessage() and SBMLError.getMessage().  The former
    provides a brief one-line description of the issue, while
    SBMLError.getMessage() provides a more detailed text, including (if
    appropriate) references to sections of the SBML specifications where
    relevant topics are discussed.  These text strings are suitable for
    displaying to human users.

    @if clike
    An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
    retrieved using the method SBMLError.getCategory().  Category values
    are drawn from the enumeration <a class='el'
    href='#SBMLErrorCategory_t'>SBMLErrorCategory_t</a> described below.
    Categories are used to partition errors into distinct conceptual groups.
    This is principally used by the libSBML validation system to group
    classes of validation checks.  For example, 
    @link libsbml.LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY@endlink
    is the category for tests that check identifier consistency;
    @link libsbml.LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY@endlink
    is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
    so on.
    @endif@if java
    An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be

    are drawn from a set of static integer constants
    defined in <code><a href='libsbmlConstants.html'>libsbmlConstants</a></code>,
    and having names beginning with the characters
    <code>LIBSBML_CAT_</code>.  The list of possible codes is described in a
    separate section below.  Categories are used to partition errors into
    distinct conceptual groups.  This is principally used by the libSBML
    validation system to group classes of validation checks.  For example,
    @link libsbml.LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY@endlink
    is the category for tests that check identifier consistency;
    @link libsbml.LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY@endlink

    is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
    so on.
    @endif

    In addition, SBMLError also has a severity code.  Its value may be
    retrieved using the method SBMLError.getSeverity().  The possible
    severity values are the same as those reported by @if clike XMLError.@endif@if python XMLError.@endif@if java <code><a href='XMLError.html'>XMLError</a></code>.@endif 
    Severity levels currently range from informational
    (@link libsbml.LIBSBML_SEV_INFO LIBSBML_SEV_INFO@endlink)
    to fatal errors
    (@link libsbml.LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL@endlink).
    They can be
    used by an application to evaluate how serious a given problem
    is. 

    Finally, SBMLError records the line and column near where the problem
    occurred in the SBML content.  The values may be retrieved using the
    methods SBMLError.getLine() and SBMLError.getColumn().  We say 'near',
    because a lot of factors affect how accurate the line/column information
    ultimately is.  For example, different XML parsers have different
    conventions for which line and column number they report for a
    particular problem (which makes a difference when a problem involves an
    opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on another line).  In some
    situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers
    altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or column number
    in the SBMLError object to the the value of the maximum unsigned long
    integer representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  (This
    is equal to the constant named <code>ULONG_MAX</code> in C and C++.)
    The probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model would
    equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
    encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
    line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.

    <h3><a class='anchor' name='SBMLErrorCode_t'>SBMLErrorCode_t</a></h3>

    SBMLErrorCode_t is an enumeration of all SBML-level error, warning and
    informational diagnostic codes.  Every SBMLError object has an error
    code value that can be either a value from this enumeration, or a value
    from the @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink
    enumeration (see the documentation for XMLError).  The latter values
    apply when the error or warning signifies a basic XML issue rather than
    an SBML issue per se.  The values of SBMLErrorCode_t are distinguished
    from those of @link XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t @endlink by
    being numbered 10000 and higher, while the XML layer's codes are 9999 and
    lower.  The method SBMLError.getErrorId() returns the error code of a
    given SBMLError object instance.

    The following is a table of the symbolic names of SBMLErrorCode_t values
    and the meaning of each code.  In this table, the right-hand columns
    titled 'L1V1', 'L1V2', etc. refer to Levels and Versions of the SBML
    specifications, and the entries in each column refer to whether the
    severity of the condition in that particular Level+Version of SBML.

        @p errorId to this constructor @em can be (but does not have to be) a
        value from this @if clike enumeration. If it @em is a value
        from <a class='el' href='#SBMLErrorCode_t'>SBMLErrorCode_t</a>, the
        SBMLError class assumes the error is a low-level system or SBML layer
        error and <em>prepends</em> a built-in, predefined error message to
        any string passed in the argument @p details to this constructor.  In
        addition, all <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorCode_t'>SBMLErrorCode_t</a> errors have associated
        values for the @p severity and @p category codes, and these fields are
        filled-in as well from the enumerations <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorSeverity_t'>SBMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class='el'

        passed in the argument @p details to this constructor.  In addition,
        all the predefined error identifiers have associated values for the 
        @p severity and @p category codes, and these fields are filled-in using
        the libSBML defaults for each different error identifier. @endif

        If the error identifier @p errorId is a number greater than 99999, the
        SBMLError class assumes the error was generated from another part of
        the software and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
        the default in the constructor itself.  This allows SBMLError to serve
        as a base class for other errors, such as for user-defined validation
        rules (see Validator).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with
        suitable values if generating errors with codes greater than 99999 to
        make maximum use of the SBMLError facilities.

        @if clike As mentioned above, there are two other
        enumerations, <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorSeverity_t'>SBMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorCategory_t'>SBMLErrorCategory_t</a>, used for indicating
        the severity and category of error for the predefined SBMLError codes.
        The values passed in @p severity and @p category override the defaults
        assigned based on the error code.  If the value of @p errorId is a
        value from <a class='el' href='#SBMLErrorCode_t'>SBMLErrorCode_t</a>,
        callers do not need to fill in @p severity and @p category.
        Conversely, if @p errorId is not a value from <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorCode_t'>SBMLErrorCode_t</a>, callers can use other
        values (not just those from <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorSeverity_t'>SBMLErrorSeverity_t</a> and <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorCategory_t'>SBMLErrorCategory_t</a>, but their own
        special values) for @p severity and 
        @p category. @else As mentioned above, 
        there are additional constants defined for <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorSeverity_t'>standard severity</a> and <a class='el'
        href='#SBMLErrorCategory_t'>standard category</a> codes, and every predefined 
        error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category taken
        from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
        prefixed with <code>LIBSBML_SEV_</code> and <code>LIBSBML_CAT_</code>,
        respectively.  If the value of @p errorId is one of the standard error
        codes, callers do not need to fill in @p severity and @p category in a
        call to this constructor.  Conversely, if @p errorId is not an existing
        SBML-level error code, callers can use other values for @p severity and
        @p category. @endif

    Representation of MIRIAM-compliant controlled vocabulary annotation.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    The SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specifications define a simple
    format for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary
    terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and
    biochemical entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the
    model's modification history.  This SBML format is a concrete syntax that
    conforms to the guidelines of MIRIAM ('Minimum Information Requested in
    the Annotation of biochemical Models', <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>,
    vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  The format uses a subset of W3C RDF (<a
    target='_blank' href='http://www.w3.org/RDF/'>Resource Description
    Format</a>).  In order to help application developers work with
    annotations in this format, libSBML provides several helper classes that
    provide higher-level interfaces to the data elements; these classes
    include CVTerm, ModelCreator, ModelHistory, RDFAnnotationParser, and
    Date.

    @section annotation-parts Components of an SBML annotation

    The SBML annotation format consists of RDF-based content placed inside
    an <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element attached to an SBML component
    such as Species, Compartment, etc.  The following template illustrates
    the different parts of SBML annotations in XML form:

    In the template above, the placeholder
    <span class='code' style='background-color: #bbb'>SBML_ELEMENT</span> stands for
    the XML tag name of an SBML model component (e.g., <code>model</code>,
    <code>reaction</code>, etc.) and the placeholder 
    <span class='code' style='border-bottom: 1px solid black'>meta id</span>
    stands for the element's meta identifier, which is a field available
    on all SBML components derived from the SBase base object class.
    The <span style='border-bottom: 2px dotted #888'>dotted</span>
    portions are optional, the symbol
    <span class='code' style='background-color: #d0eed0'>+++</span> is a placeholder
    for either no content or valid XML content that is not defined by
    this annotation scheme, and the ellipses
    <span class='code' style='background-color: #edd'>...</span>
    are placeholders for zero or more elements of the same form as the
    immediately preceding element.  The optional content
    <span class='code' style='background-color: #e0e0e0; border-bottom: 2px dotted #888'>HISTORY</span>
    is a creation and modification history; in libSBML, this is stored
    using ModelHistory objects.

    The placeholder <span class='code' style='background-color: #bbb'>RELATION_ELEMENT</span>
    refers to a BioModels.net qualifier element name.  This is an element in
    either the XML namespace
    <code>'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers'</code> (for model
    qualifiers) or <code>'http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers'</code>
    (for biological qualifier).  The <span class='code' style='background-color: #d0d0ee'>URI</span>
    is a required data value that uniquely identifies a resource and
    data within that resource to which the annotation refers.  (Since
    a URI is only a label, not an address, applications will often
    want a means of looking up the resource to which the URI refers.
    Providing the facilities for doing this is the purpose of
    <a target='_blank' href='http://biomodels.net/miriam'>MIRIAM Resources</a>.)

    The relation-resource pairs above are the 'controlled vocabulary' terms
    that which CVTerm is designed to store and manipulate.  The next section
    describes these parts in more detail.  For more information about
    SBML annotations in general, please refer to Section&nbsp;6 in the
    SBML Level&nbsp;2 (Versions 2&ndash;4) or Level&nbsp;3 specification
    documents.


    @section cvterm-parts The parts of a CVTerm

    Annotations that refer to controlled vocabularies are managed in libSBML
    using CVTerm objects.  A set of RDF-based annotations attached to a
    given SBML <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element are read by
    RDFAnnotationParser and converted into a list of these CVTerm objects.
    Each CVTerm object instance stores the following components of an
    annotation:

    <ul>

    <li>The @em qualifier, which can be a BioModels.net 'biological
    qualifier', a BioModels.net 'model qualifier', or an unknown qualifier
    (as far as the CVTerm class is concerned).  Qualifiers are used in
    MIRIAM to indicate the nature of the relationship between the object
    being annotated and the resource.  In CVTerm, the qualifiers can be
    manipulated using the methods CVTerm.getQualifierType(),
    CVTerm.setQualifierType(), and related methods.

    <li>The @em resource, represented by a URI (which, we must remind
    developers, is not the same as a URL).  In the CVTerm class, the
    resource component can be manipulated using the methods
    CVTerm.addResource() and
    CVTerm.removeResource().

    </ul>

    Note that a CVTerm contains a single qualifier, but possibly more than
    one resource.  This corresponds to the possibility of an annotation that
    points to multiple resources, all of which are qualified by the same
    BioModels.net qualifier.  The CVTerm object class supports this by
    supporting a list of resources.

    Detailed explanations of the qualifiers defined by BioModels.net can be
    found at <a target='_blank'
    href='http://biomodels.net/qualifiers'>http://biomodels.net/qualifiers</a>.

        Method variant with the following signature:

        Creates an empty CVTerm, optionally with the given
        @if clike #QualifierType_t value@else qualifier@endif &nbsp; @p type.

        The SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specifications define a simple
        format for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled
        vocabulary terms and database identifiers that define and describe
        biological and other entities, and (b) describing the creator of a
        model and the model's modification history.  The annotation content is
        stored in <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> elements attached to
        individual SBML elements.  The format for storing the content inside
        SBML <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> elements is a subset of W3C RDF
        (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.w3.org/RDF/'>Resource Description
        Format</a>) expressed in XML.  The CVTerm class provides a programming
        interface for working directly with controlled vocabulary term ('CV
        term') objects without having to deal directly with the XML form.
        When libSBML reads in an SBML model containing RDF annotations, it
        parses those annotations into a list of CVTerm objects, and when
        writing a model, it parses the CVTerm objects back into the
        appropriate SBML <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> structure.

        This method creates an empty CVTerm object.  The possible qualifier
        types usable as values of @p type are @link
        libsbml.MODEL_QUALIFIER MODEL_QUALIFIER@endlink and @link
        libsbml.BIOLOGICAL_QUALIFIER BIOLOGICAL_QUALIFIER@endlink.  If
        an explicit value for @p type is not given, this method defaults to
        using @link libsbml.UNKNOWN_QUALIFIER
        UNKNOWN_QUALIFIER@endlink.  The
        @if clike #QualifierType_t value@else qualifier type@endif 
        can be set later using the
        CVTerm.setQualifierType() method.

        Different BioModels.net qualifier elements encode different types of
        relationships.  Please refer to the SBML specification or the <a
        target='_blank' href='http://biomodels.net/qualifiers/'>BioModels.net
        qualifiers web page</a> for an explanation of the meaning of these
        different qualifiers.

        This method creates a CVTerm object from the XMLNode object @p node.
        Recall that XMLNode is a node in an XML tree of elements, and each
        such element can be placed in a namespace.  This constructor looks for
        the element to be in the XML namespaces
        <code>'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers'</code> (for
        model qualifiers) and
        <code>'http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers'</code> (for
        biological qualifier), and if they are, creates CVTerm objects for
        the result.

        @param node an %XMLNode representing a CVTerm.

        the correct structural form.

        addResource(self, string resource) -> int

        Adds a resource reference to this CVTerm object.

        The SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specifications define a simple
        standardized format for annotating models with references to
        controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers that define and
        describe biological or other entities.  This annotation format
        consists of RDF-based content placed inside an
        <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element attached to an SBML component
        such as Species, Compartment, etc.

        The specific RDF element used in this SBML format for referring to
        external entities is <code>&lt;rdf:Description&gt;</code>, with a
        <code>&lt;rdf:Bag&gt;</code> element containing one or more
        <code>&lt;rdf:li&gt;</code> elements.  Each such element refers to a
        data item in an external resource; the resource and data item are
        together identified uniquely using a URI.  The following template
        illustrates the structure:

          <DIV class='fragment'>
          &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;#<span style='border-bottom: 1px solid black'>meta id</span>&quot;&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background-color: #e0e0e0; border-bottom: 2px dotted #888'>HISTORY</span><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span style='background-color: #bbb'>RELATION_ELEMENT</span>&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;rdf:Bag&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;<span style='background-color: #d0d0ee'>resource URI</span>&quot; /&gt;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='background-color: #edd'>...</span><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/rdf:Bag&gt;<br>

          &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;<br>
          </div>

        In the template above, the placeholder <span class='code'
        style='border-bottom: 1px solid black'>meta id</span> stands for the
        element's meta identifier, which is a field available on all SBML
        components derived from the SBase base object class.  The <span
        style='border-bottom: 2px dotted #888'>dotted</span> portions are
        optional, and the ellipses <span class='code' style='background-color:
        #edd'>...</span> are placeholders for zero or more elements of the
        same form as the immediately preceding element.  The placeholder <span
        class='code' style='background-color: #bbb'>RELATION_ELEMENT</span>
        refers to a BioModels.net qualifier element name.  This is an element
        in either the XML namespace
        <code>'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers'</code> (for model
        qualifiers) or <code>'http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers'</code>
        (for biological qualifier).

        The <span class='code' style='background-color: #d0d0ee'>resource
        URI</span> is a required data value that uniquely identifies a
        resource and data within that resource to which the annotation refers.
        The present method allows callers to add a reference to a resource URI
        with the same relationship to the enclosing SBML object.  (In other
        words, the argument to this method is a <span class='code'
        style='background-color: #d0d0ee'>resource URI</span> as shown in the
        XML fragment above.)  Resources are stored in this CVTerm object
        within an XMLAttributes object.

        The relationship of this CVTerm to the enclosing SBML object can be
        determined using the CVTerm methods such as getModelQualifierType()
        and getBiologicalQualifierType().

        @param resource a string representing the URI of the resource and data
        item being referenced; e.g.,

    Representation of MIRIAM-compliant dates used in ModelHistory.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    A Date object stores a reasonably complete representation of date and
    time.  Its purpose is to serve as a way to store dates to be read and
    written in the <a target='_blank'
    href='http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime'>W3C date format</a> used in
    RDF Dublin Core annotations within SBML.  The W3C date format is a
    restricted form of <a target='_blank'
    href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601'>ISO 8601</a>, the
    international standard for the representation of dates and times.  A
    time and date value in this W3C format takes the form
    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssXHH:ZZ (e.g., <code>1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00</code>)
    where XHH:ZZ is the time zone offset.  The libSBML Date object contains
    the following fields to represent these values:
    <ul>

    <li> @em year: a long integer representing the year.  This should be a
    four-digit number such as @c 2011.

    <li> @em month: a long integer representing the month, with a range of
    values of 1&ndash;12.  The value @c 1 represents January, and so on.

    <li> @em day: a long integer representing the day of the month, with a
    range of values of 1&ndash;31.

    <li> @em hour: a long integer representing the hour on a 24-hour clock,
    with a range of values of 0&ndash;23.

    <li> @em minute: a long integer representing the minute, with a range
    of 0&ndash;59.

    <li> @em second: a long integer representing the second, with a range
    of 0&ndash;59.

    <li> @em sign: a long integer representing the sign of the offset (@c 0
    signifying @c + and @c 1 signifying @c -).  See the paragraph below for
    further explanations.

    <li> @em hours offset: a long integer representing the time zone's hour
    offset from GMT.

    <li> @em minute offset: a long integer representing the time zone's
    minute offset from GMT.

    </ul>

    To illustrate the time zone offset, a value of <code>-05:00</code> would
    correspond to USA Eastern Standard Time.  In the Date object, this would
    require a value of @c 1 for the sign field, @c 5 for the hour offset and
    @c 0 for the minutes offset.

    In the restricted RDF annotations used in SBML, described in
    Section&nbsp;6 of the SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3 specification
    documents, date/time stamps can be used to indicate the time of
    creation and modification of a model.  The following SBML model fragment
    illustrates this:

        @param second a long integereger representing the second, with a
        range of 0&ndash;59.  (Default value used if this argument is not
        given: @c 0.)

        @param sign a long integereger representing the sign of the offset

        below for further explanations.  (Default value used if this argument
        is not given: @c 0.)

        @param hoursOffset a long integereger representing the time zone's
        hour offset from GMT.  (Default value used if this argument is not
        given: @c 0.)

        @param minutesOffset a long integereger representing the time zone's
        minute offset from GMT.  (Default value used if this argument is not
        given: @c 0.)

        To illustrate the time zone offset, a value of <code>-05:00</code>
        would correspond to USA Eastern Standard Time.  In the Date object,
        this would require a value of @c 1 for the sign field, @c 5 for the
        hour offset and @c 0 for the minutes offset.

        Method variant with the following signature:
        <pre class='signature'>Date(string date)</pre>

        Creates a Date object from a string expressing a date and time value.

        This constructor expects its argument to be in the <a target='_blank'
        href='http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime'>W3C date format with time
        zone offset</a>, used in RDF Dublin Core annotations within SBML.
        This format expresses a date and time value as a string of the form
        YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssXHH:ZZ, where
        <ul>

        <li> @em YYYY is a four-digit integer representing the year.  This
        should be a four-digit number such as @c 2011.

        <li> @em MM is a two-digit integer representing the month, with a range
        of values of 01&ndash;12.  The value @c 1 represents January, and so
        on.

        <li> @em DD is a two-digit integer representing the day of the month,
        with a range of values of 01&ndash;31.

        <li> @em hh is a two-digit integer representing the hour on a 24-hour
        clock, with a range of values of 00&ndash;23.

        <li> @em mm is a two-digit integer representing the minute, with a
        range of 00&ndash;59.

        <li> @em ss is a two-digit integer representing the second, with a
        range of 0&ndash;59.

        <li> @em X is the the sign of the time zone offset, either @c + or
        <code>-</code>.

        <li> @em HH is a two-digit integer representing the hour of the time
        zone offset, with a range of 00&ndash;23.

        <li> @em ZZ is a two-digit integer representing the minutes of the time
        zone offset, with a range of 00&ndash;59.

        </ul>

        In the string format above, it is important not to forget the literal
        character @c T in the string.  Here is an example date/time string:
        <code>1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00</code>, which would represent July 16,
        1997, at 19:20:30 in Central European Time (which is UTC +1:00).

    The SBML specification beginning with Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2
    defines a standard approach to recording model history and model creator
    information in a form that complies with MIRIAM ('Minimum Information
    Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models', <i>Nature
    Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  For the model creator,
    this form involves the use of parts of the <a target='_blank'
    href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard'>vCard</a> representation.
    LibSBML provides the ModelCreator class as a convenience high-level
    interface for working with model creator data.  Objects of class
    ModelCreator can be used to store and carry around creator data within a
    program, and the various methods in this object class let callers
    manipulate the different parts of the model creator representation.

    @section parts The different parts of a model creator definition

    The ModelCreator class mirrors the structure of the MIRIAM model creator
    annotations in SBML.  The following template illustrates these different
    fields when they are written in XML form:

    Representation of MIRIAM-compliant model history data.

    @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html

    The SBML specification beginning with Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2
    defines a standard approach to recording optional model history and
    model creator information in a form that complies with MIRIAM ('Minimum
    Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models',
    <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  LibSBML
    provides the ModelHistory class as a convenient high-level interface
    for working with model history data.

    Model histories in SBML consist of one or more <em>model creators</em>,
    a single date of @em creation, and one or more @em modification dates.
    The overall XML form of this data takes the following form:

    a subset of RDF in SBML.  The general scheme is as follows.  A set of
    RDF-based annotations attached to a given SBML
    <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element are read by RDFAnnotationParser
    and converted into a list of CVTerm objects.  There
    are different versions of the main method, @if clike RDFAnnotationParser.parseRDFAnnotation() @else RDFAnnotationParser.parseRDFAnnotation() @endif

    class, ModelHistory, is used to make it easier to manipulate model
    history annotations.

      <ol>
        <li> typedef for the package specific SBMLExtensionNamespaces template class
          <p> For example, the typedef for GroupsExtension (defined in the groups package) is implemented in GroupsExtension.h as follows:</p>

       // SBase derived classes defined in groups package.

         SBMLNamespaces and can be used as an argument of constructors

        SBMLDocument object with the groups package as follows:
      </p>

     @verbatim
        GroupsPkgNamespaces gpns(3,1,1);
        SBMLDocument doc;

     @verbatim
           typedef enum

     <p> <em>SBML_GROUPS_GROUP</em> corresponds to the Group class (&lt;group&gt;)
    and <em>SBML_GROUPS_MEMBER</em> corresponds to the Member (&lt;member&gt;) class, respectively.


     <p> Similarly, SBMLLayoutTypeCode_t 
      for layout package is defined in LayoutExtension.h as follows: </p>

     @verbatim  
           typedef enum
           {
              SBML_LAYOUT_BOUNDINGBOX           = 100

            , SBML_LAYOUT_GRAPHICALOBJECT       = 105

           } SBMLLayoutTypeCode_t;
     @endverbatim

     <p>
      These enum values are returned by corresponding getTypeCode() functions.
      (e.g. SBML_GROUPS_GROUP is returned in Group.getTypeCode())
     </p>

     <p>
      The value of each typecode can be duplicated between those of different 
      packages (In the above SBMLayoutTypeCode_t and SBMLGroupsTypeCode_t types, 
      unique values are assigned to enum values, but this is not mandatory.)
     </p>

     <p>
      Thus, to distinguish the typecodes of different packages, not only the return
      value of getTypeCode() function but also that of getPackageName()
      function should be checked as follows:
     </p>

        the derived class and registering code which registers the instance to 
        SBMLExtensionRegistry class are implemented.
    </p>

       //
       //-------------------------------------------------------------------------

       //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       //
       // 3. Creates SBasePluginCreatorBase derived objects required for this 
       //    extension. The derived classes can be instantiated by using the following 
       //     template class.
       //
       //    temaplate<class SBasePluginType> class SBasePluginCreator
       //
       //    The constructor of the creator class has two arguments:
       //
       //        (1) SBaseExtensionPoint : extension point to which the plugin object connected
       //        (2) std::vector<string> : a std::vector object that contains a list of URI
       //                                       (package versions) supported by the plugin object.
       //
       //    For example, two plugin objects (plugged in SBMLDocument and Model elements) are 
       //    required for the groups extension.
       //
       //    Since only 'required' attribute is used in SBMLDocument by the groups package, existing
       //    SBMLDocumentPlugin class can be used as-is for the plugin.
       //
       //    Since the lists of supported package versions (currently only L3V1-groups-V1 supported )
       //    are equal in the both plugin objects, the same vector object is given to each 
       //    constructor.
       //
       //---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       std::vector<string> packageURIs;
       packageURIs.push_back(getXmlnsL3V1V1());

       SBaseExtensionPoint sbmldocExtPoint('core',SBML_DOCUMENT);
       SBaseExtensionPoint modelExtPoint('core',SBML_MODEL);

       SBasePluginCreator<SBMLDocumentPlugin, GroupsExtension> sbmldocPluginCreator(sbmldocExtPoint,packageURIs);
       SBasePluginCreator<GroupsModelPlugin,   GroupsExtension> modelPluginCreator(modelExtPoint,packageURIs);

       //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       //
       // 3. Adds the above SBasePluginCreatorBase derived objects to the SBMLExtension derived object.
       //
       //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       groupsExtension.addSBasePluginCreator(&sbmldocPluginCreator);
       groupsExtension.addSBasePluginCreator(&modelPluginCreator);

       //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
