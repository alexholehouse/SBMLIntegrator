/** 
 * LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Reaction construct.
 *
 * A @em reaction represents any transformation, transport or binding
 * process, typically a chemical reaction, that can change the quantity of
 * one or more species.  In SBML, a reaction is defined primarily in terms
 * of the participating reactants and products (and their corresponding
 * stoichiometries), along with optional modifier species, an optional rate
 * at which the reaction takes place, and optional parameters.  
 * 
 * As with other major object in SBML, Reaction has a mandatory attribute,
 * 'id', used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The identifier
 * must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in
 * SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3, the reaction 'id'
 * identifier can be used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an SBML
 * model to represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained
 * below.  Reaction also has an optional 'name' attribute, of type @c
 * string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the guidelines
 * described in the SBML specification.
 *
 * The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers in a
 * reaction are declared using lists of SpeciesReference and/or
 * ModifierSpeciesReference instances stored in subelements
 * 'listOfReactants', 'listOfProducts' and 'listOfModifiers'.  Certain
 * restrictions are placed on the appearance of species in reaction
 * definitions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product of any
 * reaction in a model is governed by certain flags in that species'
 * definition; see the definition of Species for more information.
 *
 * <li> Any species appearing in the mathematical formula of the subelement
 * 'kineticLaw' (described below) of a Reaction must be declared in at
 * least one of that Reaction's lists of reactants, products, and/or
 * modifiers.  Put another way, it is an error for a reaction's kinetic law
 * formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that
 * reaction.
 *
 * <li> A reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants
 * <em>or</em> an empty list of products, but it must have at least one
 * reactant or product; in other words, a reaction without any reactant or
 * product species is not permitted.  (This restriction does not apply to
 * modifier species, which remain optional in all cases.)
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A reaction can contain up to one KineticLaw object in a subelement named
 * 'kineticLaw'.  It defines the speed at which the process defined by the
 * reaction takes place.  The description of KineticLaw provides more
 * details about its use.  Note that although the inclusion of a KineticLaw
 * object in an instance of a Reaction component is optional, there is no
 * useful default that can be substituted in place of a missing rate
 * expression in a reaction.  Moreover, a reaction's rate cannot be defined
 * in any other way in SBML&mdash;InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule,
 * RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and other constructs in SBML cannot be
 * used to set the reaction rate separately.  Nevertheless, for some
 * modeling applications, reactions without any defined rate can be
 * perfectly acceptable.
 *
 * Reaction also has a bool attribute named 'reversible' for indicating
 * whether the reaction is reversible.  This attribute is optional in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2, with a default of @c true; it is mandatory in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  To say that a reaction is @em
 * reversible is to say it can proceed in either the forward or the reverse
 * direction.  Although the reversibility of a reaction can sometimes be
 * deduced by inspecting its rate expression, this is not always the case,
 * especially for complicated expressions.  Moreover, the need in SBML to
 * allow rate expressions (i.e., KineticLaw) to be optional leads to the
 * need for a separate flag indicating reversibility.  Note that labeling a
 * reaction as irreversible is an assertion that the reaction always
 * proceeds in the given forward direction.  (Why else would it be flagged
 * as irreversible?)  This implies the rate expression in the KineticLaw
 * always has a non-negative value during simulations.  Software tools
 * could provide a means of optionally testing that this condition holds.
 * The presence of reversibility information in two places (i.e., the rate
 * expression and the 'reversible' attribute on Reaction) leaves open the
 * possibility that a model could contain contradictory information, but
 * the creation of such a model would be an error on the part of the
 * software generating it.
 *
 * The Reaction object class has another bool attribute called 'fast'.
 * This attribute is optional in SBML Level&nbsp;2, with a default of @c
 * false; it is mandatory in SBML Level&nbsp;3 (with no default value).  It
 * is used to indicate that a reaction occurs on a vastly faster time scale
 * than others in a system.  Readers are directed to the SBML Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;4 specification, which provides more detail about the
 * conditions under which a reaction can be considered to be fast in this
 * sense.  The attribute's default value is @c false.  SBML Level&nbsp;1
 * and Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 incorrectly claimed that software tools
 * could ignore this attribute if they did not implement support for the
 * corresponding concept; however, further research in SBML has revealed
 * that this is not true, and 'fast' <em>cannot be ignored</em> if it is
 * set to @c true.  SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4 therefore
 * stipulate that if a model has any reactions with 'fast' set to @c true,
 * a software tool must be able to respect the attribute or else indicate
 * to the user that it does not have the capacity to do so.  Analysis
 * software cannot ignore the value of the 'fast' attribute because doing
 * so may lead to different results as compared to a software system that
 * <em>does</em> make use of 'fast'.
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1, the Reaction object has an
 * additional optional attribute named 'compartment', whose value must be
 * the identifier of a compartment defined in the enclosing Model object.
 * The 'compartment' attribute can be used to indicate the compartment in
 * which the reaction is assumed to take place.  If the attribute is
 * present, its value must be the identifier of a Compartment object
 * defined in the enclosing Model object.  Similar to the 'reversible'
 * attribute, the value of the 'compartment' attribute has no direct impact
 * on the construction of mathematical equations for the SBML model.  When
 * a kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment location may
 * already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this cannot always be
 * guaranteed).  Nevertheless, software tools may find the 'compartment'
 * attribute value useful for such purposes as analyzing the structure of
 * the model, guiding the modeler in constructing correct rate formulas,
 * and visualization purposes.
 *
 * Readers are urged to read the SBML specification for more details about
 * the proper use of Reaction.
