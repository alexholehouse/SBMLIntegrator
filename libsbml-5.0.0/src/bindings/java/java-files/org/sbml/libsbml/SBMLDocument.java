/** 
 * Container for an SBML document and interface for global operations
 * on SBML documents.
 * <p>
 * LibSBML uses the class {@link SBMLDocument} as a top-level
 * container for storing SBML content and data associated with it (such as
 * warnings and error messages).  The two primary means of reading an SBML
 * model, {@link SBMLReader#readSBML(String filename)} and
 * {@link SBMLReader#readSBMLFromString(String xml)}, both return an {@link SBMLDocument}
 * object.  From there, callers can inquire about any errors encountered
 * (e.g., using {@link SBMLDocument#getNumErrors()}), access the {@link Model} object, and
 * perform other actions such as consistency-checking and model
 * translation.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * When creating fresh models programmatically, the starting point is
 * typically the creation of an {@link SBMLDocument} object instance.  The
 * {@link SBMLDocument} constructor accepts arguments for the SBML Level and
 * Version of the model to be created.  After creating the {@link SBMLDocument}
 * object, calling programs then typically call {@link SBMLDocument#createModel()}
 * almost immediately, and then proceed to call the methods on the {@link Model}
 * object to fill out the model's contents.
 * <p>
 * {@link SBMLDocument} corresponds roughly to the class <i>Sbml</i> defined in the
 * SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification and <i>SBML</i> in the Level&nbsp;3
 * specification.  It does not have a direct correspondence in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;1.  (However, to make matters simpler for applications,
 * libSBML creates an {@link SBMLDocument} no matter whether the model is
 * Level&nbsp;1, Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.)  In its barest form, when written out in
 * XML format for (e.g.) SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4, the corresponding
 * structure is the following:
 * <div class='fragment'><pre>
&lt;sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4' level='2' version='4'&gt;
  ...
&lt;/sbml&gt;</pre></div>
 * <p>
 * {@link SBMLDocument} is derived from {@link SBase}, and therefore contains the usual {@link SBase}
 * attributes (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 and Level&nbsp;3) of 'metaid' and 'sboTerm', as
 * well as the subelements 'notes' and 'annotation'.  It also contains the
 * attributes 'level' and 'version' indicating the Level and Version of the
 * SBML data structure.  These can be accessed using the methods defined by
 * the {@link SBase} class for that purpose.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Checking consistency and adherence to SBML specifications</h2>
 * <p>
 * One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to perform
 * SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML specification
 * for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses.  {@link SBMLDocument}
 * provides the methods for running consistency-checking and validation
 * rules on the SBML content.
 * <p>
 * First, a brief explanation of the rationale is in order.  In libSBML
 * versions up to and including the version&nbsp;3.3.x series, the
 * individual methods for creating and setting attributes and other
 * components were quite lenient, and allowed a caller to compose SBML
 * entities that might not, in the end, represent valid SBML.  This allowed
 * applications the freedom to do things such as save incomplete models
 * (which is useful when models are being developed over long periods of
 * time).  In the version&nbsp;4.x series, libSBML is somewhat stricter,
 * but still permits structures to be created independently and the results
 * to be combined in a separate step.  In all these cases, it means that a
 * separate validation step is necessary when a calling program finally
 * wants to finish a complete SBML document.
 * <p>
 * The primary interface to this validation facility is {@link SBMLDocument}'s
 * {@link SBMLDocument#checkInternalConsistency()} and
 * {@link SBMLDocument#checkConsistency()}.  The former verifies the basic
 * internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter
 * implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the
 * SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML).
 * <p>
 * The checks performed by {@link SBMLDocument#checkInternalConsistency()} are
 * hardwired and cannot be changed by calling programs, but the validation
 * performed by {@link SBMLDocument#checkConsistency()} is under program control
 * using the method {@link SBMLDocument#setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean
 * onoff)}.  Applications can selectively disable specific kinds of checks
 * that they may not be interested by calling
 * {@link SBMLDocument#setConsistencyChecks(int categ, boolean onoff)} with
 * appropriate parameters.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * These methods have slightly different relevance depending on whether a
 * model is created programmaticaly from scratch, or whether it is read in
 * from a file or data stream.  The following table summarizes the possible
 * scenarios.
 * <p>
 * <center>

 * <p>
 * <h2>Converting documents between Levels and Versions of SBML</h2>
 * <p>
 * LibSBML provides facilities for limited translation of SBML between
 * Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications.  The method for doing is
 * is {@link SBMLDocument#setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict)} .  In 
 * general, models can be converted upward without difficulty (e.g., from
 * SBML Level&nbsp;1 to Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of
 * Level&nbsp;2 to the latest Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models
 * can be translated downward as well, if they do not use constructs
 * specific to more advanced Levels of SBML.
 * <p>
 * Calling {@link SBMLDocument#setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver, boolean strict)}  will not <em>necessarily</em> lead
 * to a successful conversion.  The method will return a boolean value
 * to indicate success or failure.  Callers must check the error log (see 
 * next section) attached to the {@link SBMLDocument} object after calling
 * {@link SBMLDocument#setLevelAndVersion(long lev, long ver)}  in order to assess whether any
 * problems arose.
 * <p>
 * If an application is interested in translating to a lower Level and/or
 * Version of SBML within a Level, the following methods allow for prior
 * assessment of whether there is sufficient compatibility to make a
 * translation possible:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link SBMLDocument#checkL1Compatibility()},
 * <li> {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v1Compatibility()},
 * <li> {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v2Compatibility()},
 * <li> {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v3Compatibility()}, 
 * <li> {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v4Compatibility()}, and
 * <li> {@link SBMLDocument#checkL3v1Compatibility()}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Some changes between Versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 may lead to
 * unexpected behaviors when attempting conversions in either direction.
 * For example, SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 relaxed the requirement
 * for consistency in units of measurement between expressions annd
 * quantities in a model.  As a result, a model written in Version&nbsp;4,
 * if converted to Version&nbsp;3 with no other changes, may fail
 * validation as a Version&nbsp;3 model because Version&nbsp;3 imposed
 * stricter requirements on unit consistency.
 * <p>
 * Other changes between SBML Level 2 and Level 3 make downward conversions
 * challenging.  In some cases, it means that a model converted to
 * Level&nbsp;2 from Level&nbsp;3 will contain attributes that were not
 * explicitly given in the Level&nbsp;3 model, because in Level&nbsp;2
 * these attributes may have been optional or have default values.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Error handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * Upon reading a model, {@link SBMLDocument} logs any problems encountered while
 * reading the model from the file or data stream.  The log contains
 * objects that record diagnostic information about any notable issues that
 * arose.  Whether the problems are warnings or errors, they are both
 * reported through a single common interface involving the object class
 * {@link SBMLError}.
 * <p>
 * The methods {@link SBMLDocument#getNumErrors()}, {@link SBMLDocument#getError(long n)}  and
 * {@link SBMLDocument#printErrors()} allow callers to interact with the warnings
 * or errors logged.  Alternatively, callers may retrieve the entire log as
 * an {@link SBMLErrorLog} object using the method {@link SBMLDocument#getErrorLog()}.
 * The {@link SBMLErrorLog} object provides some alternative methods for
 * interacting with the set of errors and warnings.  In either case,
 * applications typically should first call {@link SBMLDocument#getNumErrors()} to
 * find out if any issues have been logged after specific libSBML
 * operations such as the ones discussed in the sections above.  If they
 * have, then an application will should proceed to inspect the individual
 * reports using either the direct interfaces on {@link SBMLDocument} or using the
 * methods on the {@link SBMLErrorLog} object.

  /**
   * Sets the SBML Level and Version of this {@link SBMLDocument} instance,
   * attempting to convert the model as needed.
   * <p>
   * This method is the principal way in libSBML to convert models between
   * Levels and Versions of SBML.  Generally, models can be converted
   * upward without difficulty (e.g., from SBML Level&nbsp;1 to
   * Level&nbsp;2, or from an earlier Version of Level&nbsp;2 to the latest
   * Version of Level&nbsp;2).  Sometimes models can be translated downward
   * as well, if they do not use constructs specific to more advanced
   * Levels of SBML.
   * <p>
   * Before calling this method, callers may check compatibility directly
   * using the methods {@link SBMLDocument#checkL1Compatibility()},
   * {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v1Compatibility()},
   * {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v2Compatibility()},
   * {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v3Compatibility()},
   * {@link SBMLDocument#checkL2v4Compatibility()}, and
   * {@link SBMLDocument#checkL3v1Compatibility()}.
   * <p>
   * The valid combinations of SBML Level and Version as of this release
   * of libSBML are the following: 
   * <ul>
   * <li> Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;2
   * <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1
   * <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2
   * <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;3
   * <li> Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
   * <li> Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * Strict conversion applies the additional criteria that both the
   * source and the target model must be consistent SBML.  Users can
   * control the consistency checks that are applied using the
   * {@link SBMLDocument#setConsistencyChecksForConversion(int categ, boolean onoff)} method.  If either
   * the source or the potential target model have validation errors, the
   * conversion is not performed.  When a strict conversion is successful,
