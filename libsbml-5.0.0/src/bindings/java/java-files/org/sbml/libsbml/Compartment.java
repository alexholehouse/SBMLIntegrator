/** 
 * LibSBML implementation of SBML's Compartment construct.
 * <p>
 * A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are
 * located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual
 * structures inside or outside of a biological cell.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the
 * overall definition of {@link Model}, every species in an SBML model must be
 * located in a compartment.  This in turn means that if a model defines
 * any species, the model must also define at least one compartment.  The
 * reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore
 * must exist <em>somewhere</em>.  Compartments represent the <em>somewhere</em>.
 * <p>
 * {@link Compartment} has one required attribute, 'id', to give the compartment a
 * unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can
 * refer to it.  A compartment can also have an optional 'name' attribute
 * of type <code>string.</code>  Identifiers and names must be used according to the
 * guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
 * <p>
 * {@link Compartment} also has an optional attribute 'spatialDimensions' that is
 * used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the
 * compartment.  Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer
 * values of 'spatialDimensions' of <code>3</code> (i.e., a three-dimensional
 * compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional
 * compartment, a surface), or <code>1</code> (a one-dimensional compartment, a
 * line).  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the type of this attribute is <code>double</code>,
 * there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the
 * 'spatialDimensions' attribute, and there are no default values.  In SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2, the value must be a positive <code>integer</code>, and the default
 * value is <code>3</code>; the permissible values in SBML Level&nbsp;2 are <code>3</code>, 
 * <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code> (for a point).
 * <p>
 * Another optional attribute on {@link Compartment} is 'size', representing the
 * <em>initial</em> total size of that compartment in the model.  The 'size'
 * attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume (if
 * the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the
 * compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is
 * one-dimensional).  There is no default value of compartment size in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;3.  In particular, a missing 'size' value
 * <em>does not imply that the compartment size is 1</em>.  (This is unlike
 * the definition of compartment 'volume' in SBML Level&nbsp;1.)  When the
 * compartment's 'spatialDimensions' attribute does not have a value of 
 * <code>0</code>, a missing value of 'size' for a given compartment signifies that the
 * value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
 * determined by an {@link InitialAssignment}, {@link AssignmentRule}, {@link AlgebraicRule} or
 * {@link RateRule} elsewhere in the model.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there are
 * additional special requirements on the values of 'size'; we discuss them
 * in a <a href='#comp-l2'>separate section below</a>.
 * <p>
 * The units associated with a compartment's 'size' attribute value may be
 * set using the optional attribute 'units'.  The rules for setting and
 * using compartment size units differ between SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
 * Level&nbsp;3, and are discussed separately below.
 * <p>
 * Finally, the optional {@link Compartment} attribute named 'constant' is used to
 * indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after simulation
 * begins.  A value of <code>true</code> indicates the compartment's 'size' cannot be
 * changed by any other construct except {@link InitialAssignment}; a value of 
 * <code>false</code> indicates the compartment's 'size' can be changed by other
 * constructs in SBML.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, there is an additional
 * explicit restriction that if 'spatialDimensions'=<code>'0'</code>, the value
 * cannot be changed by {@link InitialAssignment} either.  Further, in
 * Level&nbsp;2, 'constant' has a default value of <code>true.</code>  In SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3, there is no default value for the 'constant' attribute.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;2</h2>
 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the default units of compartment size, and the
 * kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute 'units', interact with
 * the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment.  The value of the
 * 'units' attribute of a {@link Compartment} object must be one of the base units
 * (see {@link Unit}), or the predefined unit identifiers <code>volume</code>, <code>area</code>, 
 * <code>length</code> or <code>dimensionless</code>, or a new unit defined by a {@link UnitDefinition}
 * object in the enclosing {@link Model}, subject to the restrictions detailed in
 * the following table:

 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the
 * 'units' attribute or (if 'units' is not set) the default value listed in
 * the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has
 * a 'spatialDimensions' value greater than <code>0:</code>
 * <ul>
 * <li> The value of the 'units' attribute is used as the units of the
 * compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical
 * quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.
 * <p>
 * <li> The <code>math</code> element of an {@link AssignmentRule} or {@link InitialAssignment}
 * referring to this compartment must have identical units.
 * <p>
 * <li> In {@link RateRule} objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's
 * size, the units of the rule's <code>math</code> element must be identical to the
 * compartment's 'units' attribute divided by the default <em>time</em> units.
 * (In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size
 * are <em>compartment size</em>/<em>time</em> units.
 * <p>
 * <li> When a {@link Species} is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
 * density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration
 * value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula <em>substance</em>/
 * <em>size</em>) are those indicated by the value of the 'units' attribute on the
 * compartment in which the species is located.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Compartments with 'spatialDimensions'=<code>0</code> require special treatment in
 * this framework.  As implied above, the 'size' attribute must not have a
 * value on an SBML Level&nbsp;2 {@link Compartment} object if the
 * 'spatialDimensions' attribute has a value of <code>0.</code>  An additional
 * related restriction is that the 'constant' attribute must default to or
 * be set to <code>true</code> if the value of the 'spatialDimensions' attribute is
 * <code>0</code>, because a zero-dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.
 * <p>
 * If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a
 * compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical
 * formulas?  The answer is that such a compartment's identifier should not
 * appear in mathematical formulas in the first place&mdash;it has no
 * value, and its value cannot change.  Note also that a zero-dimensional
 * compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be
 * described in terms of amounts, not spatially-dependent measures such as
 * concentration.  Since SBML {@link KineticLaw} formulas are already in terms of
 * <em>substance</em>/<em>time</em> and not (say) <em>concentration</em>/<em>time</em>, volume
 * or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in
 * zero-dimensional compartments.
 * <p>
 * Finally, in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, each compartment in a
 * model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular
 * compartment <em>type</em>.  The optional attribute 'compartmentType' is used
 * identify the compartment type represented by the {@link Compartment} structure.
 * The 'compartmentType' attribute's value must be the identifier of a
 * {@link CompartmentType} instance defined in the model.  If the 'compartmentType'
 * attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a
 * unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no
 * other compartment can belong to that compartment type.  The values of
 * 'compartmentType' attributes on compartments have no effect on the
 * numerical interpretation of a model.  Simulators and other numerical
 * analysis software may ignore 'compartmentType' attributes.  The
 * 'compartmentType' attribute and the {@link CompartmentType} class of objects are
 * not present in SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core nor in SBML Level&nbsp;1.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Additional considerations in SBML Level&nbsp;3</h2>
 * <p>
 * One difference between SBML Level&nbsp;3 and lower Levels of SBML is
 * that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the
 * 'spatialDimensions' attribute, and there is no default value defined for
 * the attribute.  The value of 'spatialDimensions' does not have to be an
 * integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing
 * structures with fractal dimensions.
 * <p>
 * The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter
 * into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the
 * numerical interpretation of a model.  However, the value of
 * 'spatialDimensions' <em>does</em> affect the interpretation of the units
 * associated with a compartment's size.  Specifically, the value of
 * 'spatialDimensions' is used to select among the {@link Model} attributes
 * 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and 'lengthUnits' when a {@link Compartment} object
 * does not define a value for its 'units' attribute.
 * <p>
 * The 'units' attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in
 * a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement
 * specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing {@link Model} object
 * instance.  The applicable attribute on {@link Model} depends on the value of the
 * compartment's 'spatialDimensions' attribute; the relationship is shown
 * in the table below.  If the {@link Model} object does not define the relevant
 * attribute ('volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or 'lengthUnits') for a given
 * 'spatialDimensions' value, the unit associated with that {@link Compartment}
 * object's size is undefined.  If <em>both</em> 'spatialDimensions' and 'units'
 * are left unset on a given {@link Compartment} object instance, then no unit can
 * be chosen from among the {@link Model}'s 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or
 * 'lengthUnits' attributes (even if the {@link Model} instance provides values for
 * those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them and
 * there is no default value of 'spatialDimensions'.  Leaving the units of
 * compartments' sizes undefined in an SBML model does not render the model
 * invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend
 * that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment
 * sizes.

 * <p>
 * The unit of measurement associated with a compartment's size, as defined
 * by the 'units' attribute or (if 'units' is not set) the inherited value
 * from {@link Model} according to the table above, is used in the following ways:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <p>
 * <li> When the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical
 * quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML, it represents
 * the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is
 * the value of the 'units' attribute.
 * <p>
 * <li> When a {@link Species} is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
 * density, the unit associated with the spatial size portion of the
 * concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the formula
 * <em>amount</em>/<em>size</em>) is specified by the value of the 'units'
 * attribute on the compartment in which the species is located.
 * <p>
 * <li> The 'math' elements of {@link AssignmentRule}, {@link InitialAssignment} and
 * {@link EventAssignment} objects setting the value of the compartment size
 * should all have the same units as the unit associated with the
 * compartment's size.
 * <p>
 * <li> In a {@link RateRule} object that defines a rate of change for a
 * compartment's size, the unit of the rule's 'math' element should be
 * identical to the compartment's 'units' attribute divided by the
 * model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.  (In other words, {<em>unit of
 * compartment size</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.)
 * <p>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Other aspects of {@link Compartment}</h2>
 * <p>
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;1 and Level&nbsp;2, {@link Compartment} has an optional
 * attribute named 'outside', whose value can be the identifier of another
 * {@link Compartment} object defined in the enclosing {@link Model} object.  Doing so
 * means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it.  This
 * enables the representation of simple topological relationships between
 * compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the
 * information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments).  It is
 * worth noting that in SBML, there is no relationship between compartment
 * sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the 'outside'
 * attribute.  The size of a given compartment does not in any sense
 * include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their
 * 'outside' attributes.  In other words, if a compartment <em>B</em> has the
 * identifier of compartment <em>A</em> as its 'outside' attribute value, the
 * size of <em>A</em> does not include the size of <em>B</em>.  The compartment sizes
 * are separate.
 * <p>
 * In Level&nbsp;2, there are two restrictions on the 'outside' attribute.
 * First, because a compartment with 'spatialDimensions' of <code>0</code> has no
 * size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other
 * compartment <em>except</em> compartments that <em>also</em> have
 * 'spatialDimensions' values of <code>0.</code>  Second, the directed graph formed
 * by representing {@link Compartment} structures as vertexes and the 'outside'
 * attribute values as edges must be acyclic.  The latter condition is
 * imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself.  In
 * the absence of a value for 'outside', compartment definitions in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each
 * other.
