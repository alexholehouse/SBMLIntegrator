 * @class Rule
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Rule construct.
 *
 * In SBML, @em rules provide additional ways to define the values of
 * variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors
 * of those variables.  They enable encoding relationships that cannot be
 * expressed using Reaction nor InitialAssignment objects alone.
 *
 * The libSBML implementation of rules mirrors the SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;1 Core definition (which is in turn is very similar to the
 * Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 definition), with Rule being the parent
 * class of three subclasses as explained below.  The Rule class itself
 * cannot be instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the
 * subclasses AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and RateRule can be
 * instantiated directly.
 *
 * @section general General summary of SBML rules
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into
 * three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
 * subclasses are based on the following three different possible
 * functional forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some
 * arbitrary function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a
 * vector of variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and
 * <b><em>W</em></b> is a vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):
 * 
 * <center>
 * <table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="font-size: small">
 * <tr><td width="120px"><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width="250px">left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(<b>V</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * </table>
 * </center>
 * 
 * In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
 * between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
 * separate cases for the following reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
 * intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
 * of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
 * performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>
 * 
 * <li> SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
 * the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>
 * 
 * <li> Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
 * unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
 * as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
 * could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
 * general algebraic equations;<p>
 * 
 * <li> Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
 * distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>
 * 
 * <li> Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
 * to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
 * abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, "math", to hold the
 * right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
 * attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
 * rules.  The "math" subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
 * mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
 * numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
 * the variables and other entities in an SBML model.
 * 
 * Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
 * RateRule) inherit the the "math" subelement and other fields from SBase.
 * The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
 * "variable".  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
 * RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.
 * 
 * @section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules
 * 
 * An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
 * model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
 * how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
 * restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
 * of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.
 * 
 * @subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops
 * 
 * The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
 * objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
 * considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
 * because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the "id" attribute of
 * the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
 * assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
 * chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
 * consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
 * directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
 * parameter symbol in an assignment statement's "math" subelement.  Let the
 * directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
 * statements that contain the symbol in their "math" subelement expressions.
 * This graph must be acyclic.
 * 
 * SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
 * Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
 * evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
 * changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
 * <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
 * were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
 * because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
 * of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
 * for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
 * Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
 * assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
 * + 100</em>.
 * 
 * @subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined
 * 
 * An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
 * define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
 * that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.
 * 
 * LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in
 * Appendix&nbsp;B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core
 * specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.
 * 
 * (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
 * mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
 * can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
 * One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
 * represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
 * equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
 * are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
 * there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
 * equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
 * rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
 * single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
 * differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
 * maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
 * representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
 * all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
 * necessary to find one maximal matching.)
 *
 * @section RuleType_t Rule types for SBML Level 1
 *
 * SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level&nbsp;2 and
 * Level&nbsp;3 for distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an
 * attribute whose value is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML
 * supports this using methods that work @if clike a libSBML enumeration

/**
 * @class AlgebraicRule
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %AlgebraicRule construct.
 *
 * The rule type AlgebraicRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
 * is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model
 * variables nor rates of change.  AlgebraicRule does not add any
 * attributes to the basic Rule; its role is simply to distinguish this
 * case from the other cases.
 *
 * In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all
 * times, <em>t</em> \f$\geq\f$ <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
 * expressions that involve the delay "csymbol" (see the SBML
 * specification), algebraic rules are considered to apply also at
 * <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
 * specification for additional information about the semantics of
 * assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
 * \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
 *
 * An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  The ability to define
 * arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model introduces the
 * possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the overall
 * system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions and events.
 * Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a model, for at least
 * one of the entities referenced in the rule's "math" element the value of
 * that entity must not be completely determined by other constructs in the
 * model.  This means that at least this entity must not have the attribute
 * "constant"=@c true and there must also not be a rate rule or assignment
 * rule for it.  Furthermore, if the entity is a Species object, its value
 * must not be determined by reactions, which means that it must either
 * have the attribute "boundaryCondition"=@c true or else not be involved
 * in any reaction at all.  These restrictions are explained in more detail
 * in the SBML specification documents.
 *
 * In SBML Levels 2 and&nbsp;3, Reaction object identifiers can be
 * referenced in the "math" expression of an algebraic rule, but reaction
 * rates can never be <em>determined</em> by algebraic rules.  This is true
 * even when a reaction does not contain a KineticLaw element.  (In such
 * cases of missing KineticLaw elements, the model is valid but incomplete;
 * the rates of reactions lacking kinetic laws are simply undefined, and
 * not determined by the algebraic rule.)

/**
 * @class AssignmentRule
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %AssignmentRule construct.
 *
 * The rule type AssignmentRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
 * is used to express equations that set the values of variables.  The
 * left-hand side (the attribute named "variable") of an assignment rule
 * can refer to the identifier of a Species, SpeciesReference (in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3), Compartment, or Parameter object in the model (but not a
 * Reaction).  The entity identified must have its "constant" attribute set
 * to @c false.  The effects of an AssignmentRule are in general terms the
 * same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of
 * variable being set: <ul>

 * <li> <em>In the case of a species</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
 * referenced species' quantity (whether a "concentration" or "amount") to
 * the value determined by the formula in the MathML subelement "math".
 * The unit associated with the value produced by the "math" formula @em
 * should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in
 * SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be equal to the unit
 * associated with the species' quantity.  <em>Restrictions</em>: There
 * must not be both an AssignmentRule "variable" attribute and a
 * SpeciesReference "species" attribute having the same value, unless the
 * referenced Species object has its "boundaryCondition" attribute set to
 * @c true.  In other words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a
 * species that is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species
 * is defined as a boundary condition in the model.
 *
 * <li> (For SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) <em>In the case of a species
 * reference</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the stoichiometry of the
 * referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in
 * "math".  The unit associated with the value produced by the "math"
 * formula should be consistent with the unit "dimensionless", because
 * reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
 * quantities.
  *
 * <li> <em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
 * referenced compartment's size to the value determined by the formula in
 * the "math" subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units
 * of the formula in "math" @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
 * and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
 * version&nbsp;4) be the same as the units of the size of the compartment.
 *
 * <li> <em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an AssignmentRule sets the
 * referenced parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the
 * "math" subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units of
 * the formula in the "math" subelement @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in SBML releases prior to
 * Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be the same as the units defined for the
 * parameter.  </ul>
 * 
 * In the context of a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at all
 * times, <em>t</em> \f$\geq\f$ <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
 * expressions that involve the <em>delay</em> "csymbol" (see the SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 specification), assignment rules are considered to apply
 * also at <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant
 * SBML specification for additional information about the semantics of
 * assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
 * \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
 *
 * A model must not contain more than one AssignmentRule or RateRule
 * object having the same value of "variable"; in other words, in the set
 * of all assignment rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable
 * appearing in the left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply
 * follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a
 * model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or
 * both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.
 *
 * Similarly, a model must also not contain <em>both</em> an AssignmentRule
 * and an InitialAssignment for the same variable, because both kinds of
 * constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulation time, i.e.,
 * <em>t</em> \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.  If a model contained both an initial
 * assignment and an assignment rule for the same variable, an
 * indeterminate system would result.
 *
 * The value calculated by an AssignmentRule object overrides the value
 * assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
 * example, if a Compartment object's "size" attribute value is set in its
 * definition, and the model also contains an AssignmentRule object having
 * that compartment's "id" as its "variable" value, then the "size"
 * assigned in the Compartment object definition is ignored and the value
 * assigned based on the computation defined in the AssignmentRule.  This
 * does <em>not</em> mean that a definition for a given symbol can be
 * omitted if there is an AssignmentRule object for it.  For example, there
 * must be a Parameter definition for a given parameter if there is an
 * AssignmentRule for that parameter.  It is only a question of which value
 * definition takes precedence.
 * 
 * @section general General summary of SBML rules
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into three
 * subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three

/**
 * @class RateRule
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %RateRule construct.
 *
 * The rule type RateRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It is
 * used to express equations that determine the rates of change of
 * variables.  The left-hand side (the "variable" attribute) can refer to
 * the identifier of a species, compartment, or parameter (but not a
 * reaction).  The entity identified must have its "constant" attribute set
 * to @c false.  The effects of a RateRule are in general terms the same,
 * but differ in the precise details depending on which variable is being
 * set:
 * 
 * <ul> <li> <em>In the case of a species</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of
 * change of the species' quantity (<em>concentration</em> or <em>amount of
 * substance</em>) to the value determined by the formula in the "math"
 * subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of the formula in
 * "math" @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or @em
 * must (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2 version&nbsp;4) be equal to
 * the unit of <em>species quantity</em> divided by the model-wide unit of
 * <em>time</em>.  <em>Restrictions</em>: There must not be both a RateRule
 * "variable" attribute and a SpeciesReference "species" attribute having
 * the same value, unless that species has its "boundaryCondition"
 * attribute is set to @c true.  This means a rate rule cannot be defined
 * for a species that is created or destroyed in a reaction, unless that
 * species is defined as a boundary condition in the model.
 *
 * <li> (For SBML Level&nbsp;3 only) <em>In the case of a species
 * reference</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of change of the stoichiometry
 * of the referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the
 * formula in "math".  The unit associated with the value produced by the
 * "math" formula should be consistent with the unit "dimensionless"
 * divided by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.
 *
 * <li> <em>In the case of a compartment</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of
 * change of the compartment's size to the value determined by the formula
 * in the "math" subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of
 * the formula @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
 * version&nbsp;4) be the units of the compartment's <em>size</em> divided
 * by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.
 *
 * <li> <em>In the case of a parameter</em>, a RateRule sets the rate of
 * change of the parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the
 * "math" subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of the
 * formula @em should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3) or @em must (in SBML releases prior to Level&nbsp;2
 * version&nbsp;4) be the Parameter object's "unit" attribute value divided
 * by the model-wide unit of <em>time</em>.  </ul>
 * 
 * In the context of a simulation, rate rules are in effect for simulation
 * time <em>t</em> &lt; <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
 * specification for additional information about the semantics of
 * assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
 * \f$\leq\f$ <em>0</em>.
 *
 * As mentioned in the description of AssignmentRule, a model must not
 * contain more than one RateRule or AssignmentRule object having the same
 * value of "variable"; in other words, in the set of all assignment rules
 * and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable appearing in the
 * left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply follows from the fact
 * that an indeterminate system would result if a model contained more than
 * one assignment rule for the same variable or both an assignment rule and
 * a rate rule for the same variable.
 * 
 * @section general General summary of SBML rules
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into
 * three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
 * subclasses are based on the following three different possible
 * functional forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some
 * arbitrary function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a
 * vector of variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and
 * <b><em>W</em></b> is a vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):
 * 
 * <center>
 * <table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="font-size: small">
 * <tr><td width="120px"><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width="250px">left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(<b>V</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * </table>
 * </center>
 * 
 * In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
 * between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
 * separate cases for the following reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
 * intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
 * of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
 * performed once, see InitialAssignment.)<p>
 * 
 * <li> SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
 * the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.<p>
 * 
 * <li> Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
 * unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
 * as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
 * could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
 * general algebraic equations;<p>
 * 
 * <li> Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
 * distinction between the different categories listed above; and<p>
 * 
 * <li> Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
 * to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
 * abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, "math", to hold the
 * right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
 * attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
 * rules.  The "math" subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
 * mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
 * numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
 * the variables and other entities in an SBML model.
 * 
 * Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
 * RateRule) inherit the the "math" subelement and other fields from SBase.
 * The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
 * "variable".  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
 * RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.
 * 
 * @section additional-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules
 * 
 * An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
 * model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
 * how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
 * restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
 * of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.
 * 
 * @subsection no-algebraic-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops
 * 
 * The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
 * objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
 * considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
 * because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the "id" attribute of
 * the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
 * assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops&mdash;dependency
 * chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
 * consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
 * directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
 * parameter symbol in an assignment statement's "math" subelement.  Let the
 * directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
 * statements that contain the symbol in their "math" subelement expressions.
 * This graph must be acyclic.
 * 
 * SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
 * Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
 * evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
 * changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
 * <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
 * were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
 * because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
 * of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
 * for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
 * Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
 * assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
 * + 100</em>.
 * 
 * @subsection no-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined
 * 
 * An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
 * define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
 * that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.
 * 
 * LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in
 * Appendix&nbsp;B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core
 * specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.
 * 
 * (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
 * mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
 * can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
 * One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices

/**
 * @class ListOfRules
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfRules construct.
 * 
 * The various ListOf___ classes in %SBML are merely containers used for
 * organizing the main components of an %SBML model.  All are derived from
 * the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
 * subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
 * ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
 *
 * The relationship between the lists and the rest of an %SBML model is

 * of SBML Level&nbsp;2 as well):
 *
 * @image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
 * @image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
 *
 * Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
 * containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
 * all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
 * in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
 * ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
 * components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
 * derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
 * the lists themselves into each list container's "annotation".
