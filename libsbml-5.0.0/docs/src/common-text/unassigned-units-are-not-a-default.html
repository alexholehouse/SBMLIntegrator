There is an important distinction to be made between <em>no units
assigned</em>, and assuming a value without units has any specific unit
such as <code>dimensionless</code>.  In SBML, default units are never
attributed to numbers, and numbers without units are not automatically
assumed to have the unit <code>dimensionless</code>.  Please consult the
relevant SBML specification document for a more in-depth explanation of
this topic and the SBML unit system.
