We urge developers to keep in mind that the text-string formula syntax is
specific to SBML Level&nbsp;1's C-like mathematical formula syntax.  In
particular, it is <em>not a general-purpose mathematical expression
syntax</em>.  LibSBML provides methods for parsing and transforming
text-string math formulas back and forth from AST structures, but it is
important to keep the system's limitations in mind.
