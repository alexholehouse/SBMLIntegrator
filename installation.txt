Installation instructions


- Easy way if root access is available
       1) Download the LibSBML package
       2) In Ubuntu this is as easy as 
       
		sudo apt-get install libsbml

       	  This installs the SBML C and C++ APIs in their standard
          locations.
       3) Then simply run make -f makefile_standard


- Slightly harder way
       1) Download the sbml source from
       	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/5.0.0/
       2) Unzip, cd into that directory, run configure as follows
       
       	  ./configure --prefix ~/Documents/libsbml_installation/

	  This installs the include files and the libraries on the
	  in the --prefix directory
       3) Type 
	  
	  make

       4) Type 
	
	  make install

       5) We have now installed the SBML library in our custom
          location of ~/Documents/libsbml_installation/. To ensure
	  that our compilation using the library works we must add 
	  this location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. To do this, type
	  
	  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~/Documents/libsbml_installation/lib/

	  and additionally add 

	  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~/Documents/libsbml_installation/lib/

	  to your .bashrc or .cshrc 

       6) finally, run make -f makefile_autonomous
